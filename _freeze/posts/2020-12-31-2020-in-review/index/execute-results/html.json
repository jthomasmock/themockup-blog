Rather than focusing on some of the difficulties, I'd rather focus on some of the successes for 2020.\n\nI feel very blessed that my family has stayed happy and healthy, that I have the change to continue being able to grow into expanded roles at RStudio, that I have had a lot of time with my wife Maria and our dog Howard, and that 2020 is now over. Here's to hopefully efficient vaccine delivery in 2021, and a safer new year to all!\n\n![](howard.jpg)\n\n# Growth of `#TidyTuesday`\n\nTidyTuesday has always been a labor of love for me, and the past 3 years have provided me with such a cool view of the R community, and I believe have helped thousands of learners across the world engage with the R community.\n\nIf we're using the [raw Tweet data](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/tidytuesday_tweets/data.csv), it looks like 8,601 unique tweets that reference `#TidyTuesday` along with some key plotting related words.\n\n<details><summary>Code to reproduce</summary>\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nraw_url <- \"https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/tidytuesday_tweets/data.csv?raw=true\"\n\nraw_df <- read_csv(raw_url)\n\nraw_df %>% \n  filter(\n    str_detect(tolower(text), \"rstats|code|plot|graph|viz|data|tidyverse\")\n  ) %>% \n  count()\n\nraw_df %>% \n  filter(\n    str_detect(tolower(text), \"rstats|code|plot|graph|viz|data|tidyverse\")\n  ) %>% \n  distinct(screen_name) %>% nrow()\n\nsum_df <- raw_df %>% \n  filter(str_detect(tolower(text), \"rstats|code|plot|graph|viz|data|tidyverse\")) %>% \n  mutate(created_date = lubridate::as_date(created_at),\n         year = year(created_date),\n         week = week(created_date),\n  ) %>% \n  count(year, week) %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  mutate(roll_n = cumsum(n),\n         week = if_else(year > 2018, week - 1, week - 14),\n         year = factor(year, levels = c(2020, 2019, 2018)),\n         colour = case_when(\n           year == 2020 ~ \"#003399\",\n           year == 2019 ~ \"#FF2B4F\",\n           year == 2018 ~ \"#fcab27\",\n           TRUE ~ \"gray80\"\n         )\n  ) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\ntop_weeks <- sum_df %>% \n  group_by(year) %>% \n  arrange(desc(roll_n)) %>% \n  slice(1)\n\ntt_plot <-  ggplot(\n  sum_df, \n  aes(x = week, y = roll_n, \n      color = colour, group = year)\n) +\n  geom_step(size = 1) +\n  geom_point(data = top_weeks,\n             aes(col = colour), \n             size = 2.5, stroke = 1) +\n  geom_text(data = top_weeks,\n            aes(label = year),\n            size = 8, hjust = c(1, 1, 0), nudge_y = 50,\n            vjust = 0) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, color = \"black\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 5000, by = 500),\n                     limits = c(0, 5000)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(seq(0, 50, 5), 52),\n                     limits = c(0, 53)) +\n  scale_color_identity(aesthetics = c(\"colour\", \"fill\")) +\n  labs(x = \"\\nWeek Number\", y = \"Cumulative Tweets\\n\",\n       caption = \"Data: rtweet | Plot: @thomas_mock\",\n       title = \"Cumulative tweets for #TidyTuesday by year\",\n       subtitle = \"Note that Week 1 of 2018 started in April\\nTweets must contain: 'rstats, code, plot, graph, viz, data or tidyverse'\\n\")  +\n  tomtom::theme_538() +\n  theme(legend.position = c(0.1, 0.8),\n        legend.background = element_blank(),\n        legend.title = element_blank(),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n        plot.background = element_blank(),\n        plot.title = element_text(size = 24))\n\ntt_plot\n\nggsave(\"tt-plot.png\", tt_plot, dpi = \"retina\")\n```\n:::\n\n</details>\n\n![](tt-plot.png)\n\n# Re-emphasis on blogging\n\nI had neglected my blog since Jan 2019, but kicked off with a new [blog post](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-04-03-crossing-10000-tidy-simulation/) about simulating optimal strategy for my favorite dice game \"10,000\", after seeing some Dave Robinson simulations examples. I have a strong desire to create tutorials/guides so that I can remember things for the future and to help provide some scaffolding for others to learn from as they progress through their data science learning journey.\n\n---\n\nThis really took off in March/April when Texas was heavily in lockdown and I could no longer go out to restaurants or see family. I ended up with a lot of exploration of topics, mostly for the TidyTuesday and the NFL sports analytics communities.\n\n- [Beer and PDF tools - a vignette](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-04-03-beer-and-pdftools-a-vignette/): this one covered extracting tables from many PDFs at once, which we used for a TidyTuesday dataset  \n- [Bigger, nflfastR and dbplyr](https://themockup.blog/posts/2019-04-28-nflfastr-dbplyr-rsqlite/): with the launch of `nflfastR` for large NFL play-by-play, I put together an example of creating local SQLite databases and querying them via `dplyr`  \n- [Flipping tibbles for many models](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-01-tidy-long-models/): in a previous life, I used `broom` to tidy up my stats, and in this post I covered how to run any number of models at one time by nesting dataframes and tidying them up with `broom`  \n\n---\n\nIn May, I started a \"How to make tables with R\" series, mostly focused on `gt` and `reactable`.\n\n- [QB salaries vs Playoff Appearances](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-qb-salaries-vs-playoff-appearances/): A quick example of how to use reactable  \n- [reactable - an interactives tables guide](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-13-reactable-tables-the-rest-of-the-owl/): A proper guide to how to create robust interactive tables with R  \n- [Client-side interactivity - do more with crosstalk](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-29-client-side-interactivity-do-more-with-crosstalk/): How to combine reactive plots and tables that interact with eachother via `crosstalk`, all in R!  \n- [gt - a grammar of tables](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-16-gt-a-grammer-of-tables/): How to make beautiful tables with `gt`  \n\n---\n\nI also started providing some more general resources on how to use the new `tidyr` functions to clean up deeply nested JSON, how to use RMarkdown, and some other guides.\n\n- [Easily parsing JSON in R with jsonlite and purrr](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-05-22-parsing-json-in-r-with-jsonlite/): How to use `tidyr`, `jsonlite`, and `purrr` to clean up messy JSON files  \n- [Meta RMarkdown - Taxonomy and Use Cases](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-07-25-meta-rmarkdown/): A meta-collection on how I thought about RMarkdown and some applications in how to use it in your daily workflows \n- [Bar Chart 5 ways](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-05-a-bar-chart-5-ways/): an adaption of Andy's 5 examples of some \"cool\" bar charts  \n\n---\n\nBy August, I was still stuck inside, so I put together a resource on how to start your OWN blog with `distill`, and some other guides. Eventually, [`distill` got a _HUGE_ update](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/12/07/distill/) which I provided some ideas to, although all of the _real_ work was done by Alison Hill and the RMarkdown team.\n\n- [Build a blog with distill](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/): End-to-end how to guide for building and deploying a blog to netlify for free.  \n- [Heatmaps in ggplot2](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-28-heatmaps-in-ggplot2/): Created examples of how to create various heatmaps and some info on when to choose a specific version to avoid overplotting  \n\n---\n\nSeptember kicked off a deeper focus on `gt` specifically.\n\n- [10+ guidelines for better tables in R](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-04-10-table-rules-in-r/): This was an adaption of Jon Schwabish's \"10 Guidelines for better tables\" but for R  \n- [Functions and Themes for gt tables](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-09-26-functions-and-themes-for-gt-tables/): How to create your own themes and/or re-usable functions in `gt` to save time and create beautiful tables  \n- [Embedding custom HTML in gt tables](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-10-31-embedding-custom-features-in-gt-tables/): This one was all about using various HTML/CSS to add lots of cool features to `gt` tables - even sparklines!  \n\n---\n\nIn October and November, I spent more time on plotting.\n\n- [Embedding points as images in ggplot2](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-10-11-embedding-images-in-ggplot/): This covered how to plot points as images via `ggtext` or `ggimage`, including changing axis-labels  \n- [Bullet char variants in R](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-11-29-bullet-chart-variants-in-r/): How to re-create Brian Burke's playoff leverage plots, and how to make bullet charts from scratch  \n\n---\n\nIn December, I revisited JSON data and more plotting.\n\n- [Extracting JSON from websites and public APIs in R](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-12-13-extracting-json-from-websites-and-public-apis-with-r/): How to find, access, and clean up JSON from various web endpoints like interactive visualizations, embedded into HTML, or from native APIs  \n- [Creating and using custom ggplot2 themes](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-12-26-creating-and-using-custom-ggplot2-themes/): How to make and then use your own custom themes, adapted from FiveThirtyEight and with 6 examples  \n\n\nFor 2021, I'll be continuing to blog and create technical guides - tweet at me if there's something you want to see! [@thomas_mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) .\n\n# Conferences and Presentations\n\nI gave some conference talks, mostly invited which I can attribute to being engaged with the community and technical blogging.\n\n## useR 2020\n\nI was lucky enough to both attend (virtually) and present at my first ever useR! I focused on the `#TidyTuesday` project, what it's all about, and how the community has built around it.  \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So excited to be sharing what the community has built around <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TidyTuesday</a> for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/useR2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#useR2020</a> !<br><br>&quot;TidyTuesday: Scaffolding for a Community of Practice&quot;<a href=\"https://t.co/NK3PKMACde\">https://t.co/NK3PKMACde</a><br><br>Slides: <a href=\"https://t.co/PAs1uruopZ\">https://t.co/PAs1uruopZ</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a></p>&mdash; Tom Mock (@thomas_mock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomas_mock/status/1280819050386464769?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 8, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n## NYC R\n\nGot to attend and present at my first NYC R conference, focused on doing more with RMarkdown!\n\n- [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCfLRjtRM-M)  \n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really excited to talk about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstats</a> + RMarkdown for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/rstatsnyc?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#rstatsnyc</a> in about an hr! <br><br>Slides at: <a href=\"https://t.co/AYSprYoK9d\">https://t.co/AYSprYoK9d</a> if you want to follow along or maybe live tweet!<br><br>Companion blog post: <a href=\"https://t.co/a6DbT0AA6c\">https://t.co/a6DbT0AA6c</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/5SQfrHjFim\">pic.twitter.com/5SQfrHjFim</a></p>&mdash; Tom Mock (@thomas_mock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomas_mock/status/1294670115590545408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 15, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n## Hockey Analytics Night in Canada: NFL Edition\n\nI was honored to be invited to and present at HANICx NFL, and after running a poll decided to present on the most requested topic: `tidymodels`!\n\n- [Slides](https://jthomasmock.github.io/nfl_hanic/#1): A short intro presentation on using `tidymodels` to predict whether the opposing team will run or pass  \n- [Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iwYWrh0xFw)  \n\n## NHS R Conference\n\nGave an adapted version of my RMarkdown presentation for the NHS R community, enjoyed the chatter in the live groups there!\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Really enjoyed giving my presentation on Marvelous RMarkdown for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/NHSRconf2020?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#NHSRconf2020</a> w/ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RStats?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RStats</a> !<br><br>Slides: <a href=\"https://t.co/AYSprYoK9d\">https://t.co/AYSprYoK9d</a><br>Companion Blogpost: <a href=\"https://t.co/a6DbT0AA6c\">https://t.co/a6DbT0AA6c</a><br>RMarkdown Cookbook: <a href=\"https://t.co/Ce43CUlPBg\">https://t.co/Ce43CUlPBg</a></p>&mdash; Tom Mock (@thomas_mock) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thomas_mock/status/1326923829231411202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n## Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Conference\n\nGave my first public workshop for the CMSAC team, big thanks to Ron Yorko for the invite!
