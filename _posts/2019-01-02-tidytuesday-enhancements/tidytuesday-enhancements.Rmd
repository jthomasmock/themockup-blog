One of my `#rstats` goals for 2019 was to make #TidyTuesday better, both from the experience on GitHub and the weekly posting for myself and for others.

The first thing I did for the project was to re-organize the GitHub repo, moving all the 2018 data into an archived folder and making a new 2019 folder to begin populating with new data! Additionally, with some help from [Philip Khor](https://twitter.com/philip_khor) via a pull-request - the GitHub repo is now full of relative (rather than absolute) paths to make life easier for anyone that forks the repo. 

I reorganized the [Useful Links](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/README.md) section at the bottom of the repo to make it more succinct, adding a few more links including [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan! If you are just getting started with GitHub and want to learn more about Git, GitHub, and using it from within RStudio - check out her resources!

## Ways to contribute

I'm always on the lookout for interesting datasets, and a way for you to contribute to TidyTuesday beyond a weekly post is submitting a dataset you find in the wild as an [Issue](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/issues) on the TidyTuesday repo. Please link to the dataset and add any additional info as to why you thought it was interesting or an article/plot that corresponds to that data.

I added the **Submitting Code Chunks** section directly to the readme doc. This is for some code, script, etc that you found useful when working with TidyTuesday. It's also a chance for a low-stress pull-request as that's how we will be adding code chunks! Please see the guide [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/community_resources/code_chunks/readme.md) about the format to submit.

## Improving my Weekly Tweet Submission Process

I generally switched between a lot of tabs, eg GitHub, short links, manually adding pics, etc while getting the weekly post setup. I knew there was a way to at least partially automate this, so I looked into my options.

The `rtweet` package has a post to Twitter function via `rtweet::post_tweet()` which allows you to programmatically post tweets! However - to get where I wanted to be I had to add a few more things and do some interesting refactoring!

# DISCLAIMER

To use `rtweet` for posting you will need to register a Twitter application - please see [Mike Kearney's](https://twitter.com/kearneymw) [great vignette](https://rtweet.info/articles/auth.html) on how to do this. 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
# Basic method of tweeting from rtweet vignette

post_tweet(status = "my first rtweet #rstats", media = NULL,
  token = NULL, in_reply_to_status_id = NULL, destroy_id = NULL,
  retweet_id = NULL)

```

## My Weekly `#TidyTuesday` Tweet

If I simply wanted to post a tweet following the format for `#TidyTuesday` I could do something like the following.

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
rtweet::post_tweet("The @r4dscommunity welcomes you to Week 2 of #TidyTuesday! We're exploring data about *esoteric topic*!
                   Data: link_to_data
                   Article: link_to_article",
                   media = "tt_logo.png")
```

However this results in the following Tweet:

![](wrong.png)

This is not exactly what I want... the text isn't aligned properly, I want more than 1 pic, and I really would prefer to use emoji to save characters over `Data:` and `Article:`.

So on to the next step!

Hadley Wickham has the [`emo`](https://github.com/hadley/emo) package which allows you to input various emoji into R/R Markdown. This package perfectly solves our emoji needs! I can use code like `emo::ji("folder")` to get `r emo::ji("folder")` or `emo::ji("news")` to get `r emo::ji("news")`! 

But I still need to get my text aligned properly... So I broke some formatting rules for normal code, but it got the job done for this `rtweet` use! Basically, I forced the text to be fully left-aligned, added in some spacing where necessary, and used `paste0()` to get everything squished together in a coherent tweet (with multiple pics!).

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
rtweet::post_tweet(status = paste0(
"The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week 2 of #TidyTuesday!  We're exploring *esoteric topic*!
 
",
        emo::ji("folder"),
        " http://bit.ly/tidyreadme
",
        emo::ji("news"),
        " http://cool.article.com

#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz"),

# The below code is relative to my project
# You need to specify path to the images for tweeting

        media = c("tt_logo.png",
                  "tt_rules.png")
        )

```

![](right.png)

This is a great start! However, I want to make this a bit more robust, as I don't want to edit it all by hand, when I can generate it programmatically. Refactoring code is always an adventure, so let's take a look at our code to see what is static and what changes.

### Mix of static and dynamic:  
- `The @r4dscommunity welcomes you to week {week} of #Tidy Tuesday`  
- `We're exploring {data to explore}!`  
- The link to the readme is static, but we change the link to an article.  
- The logo and rules are always the same, but up to two additional pics are dynamic.  

So how do you generate dynamic and static text together? With [`glue`](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue) of course! The `glue` package glues strings together in R, and allows for interpreted strings with the use of `{}` for example `glue::glue("Glue is an {adjective} package!")` where the `{adjective}` indicates an intepreted add-in. So if I had `adjective <- "awesome"` the string would print as `"Glue is an awesome package!"`.

Since we are going to be linking local pics, I'm also using the [`here`](https://github.com/r-lib/here) package to make moving between folders in my project easier. My folder is organized like so:
`TidyTuesday/2019/2019-01-08/`. 

So I can use `here::here("2019", "2019-01-08", "pic1.png")` to get the file directory for `pic1.png`. Since the date `2019-01-08` changes each week, I will also add it as a variable to define.

Anyway, back to refactoring.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Dynamic Variables
week_num <- 2
exploring <- "Esoteric data!"
short_link <- "http://bit.ly/WHATEVER"
week_date <- "2019-01-08"

# Static framework
rtweet::post_tweet(status = glue::glue(
"The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week {week_num} of #TidyTuesday!  We're exploring {exploring}!
 
",
        emo::ji("folder"),
        " http://bit.ly/tidyreadme
",
        emo::ji("news"),
        " {short_link}

#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz"),
# The below code is relative to my project
# You would need to specify path to the images for tweeting
        media = c(here::here("static_img", "tt_logo.png"),   # I have two static pics
                  here::here("static_img", "tt_rules.png"),  # so they go in /static
                  here::here("2019", week_date, "pic1.png"), # notice I have week_date
                  here::here("2019", week_date, "pic2.png")  # here instead of 2019-01-01
        ))
```

Now this will generate the correctly formatted tweet, include the correct additional pictures and text, but more importantly the use of `glue` and `here` means I can define the dynamic portions at the top and leave the static body the same.

However, we can refactor things further! 

We can refactor to a function AND since I only post these tweets on the Monday before `#TidyTuesday`, I can build variable dates into the function. Really the only thing I need to manually change is **`what data we are exploring`** and **`the short article link`**.

Before we get into the function, I am using a number of packages for my ease.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Packages used in this script
library(rtweet) # For Tweeting
library(glue) # For interpretation inside strings
library(emo) # For emojis!
library(lubridate) # Working with date-times
library(here) # Easier file navigation inside projects
library(purrr) # for pluck - I'm lazy. :shrug:
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Only two inputs!
# exploring = what we are exploring in text
# short_link = the article link

post_tidytuesday <- function(exploring, short_link){
        
        # set date for files structure and names
        week_date <- as.character(lubridate::today() + 1)
        
        # Today's date + 1 = tomorrow
        # Then time diff between tomorrow and 1st tidytuesday in number of weeks
        week_num <- as.numeric((lubridate::today() + 1) - lubridate::ymd(20190101))/7 + 1
        
        # post the tweet with fill
        rtweet::post_tweet(status = glue::glue(
                "The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week {week_num} of #TidyTuesday!  We're exploring {exploring}!
 
",
                emo::ji("folder"),
                " http://bit.ly/tidyreadme
",
                emo::ji("news"),
                " {short_link}

#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz"),
                
                # The below code is relative to my project
                # You need to specify path to the images for tweeting
                media = c(here::here("static_img", "tt_logo.png"),
                          here::here("static_img", "tt_rules.png"),
                          here::here("2019", week_date, "pic1.png"),
                          here::here("2019", week_date, "pic1.png")
                ))    
}
```

Now we have a nice function and when I want to post on Monday morning, I can just do the following! 

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
post_tidytuesday(
  exploring = "Esoteric data!",
  short_link = "http://bit.ly/tidy_post"
)
```
