## How Alison Hill teaches R Markdown

If you haven't read it already make sure to read [Dr. Alison Hill's fantastic blogpost](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-05-28-how-i-teach-r-markdown/):  
**`How I teach R Markdown`**

Alison is a RMarkdown superstar on the RStudio Education team. Her blogpost covers her guide on her well-informed approach for **teaching** R Markdown. 

She has taught:  
- College students as a professor across a semester  
- In person professional learners at RStudio::conf in 1-2 day workshops  
- Digital Learners in Pharma/Finance/etc via shorter online workshops  

To summarize her post:  

1. **Make it. Make it again.** - Show how knitting works throughout the process.  
2. **Make it pretty** - Engage your learners with visuals, tables, etc - motivation is key!  
3. **Make it snappy** - Get a shareable link the first 20 min (usually via Netlify Drop).  
4. **Make it real** - "Teach folks what they need to know to actually use the tool productively in real life."  
5. **Make it easy** - "People will only keep using R Markdown if they see it making their life easier. So show them how. For example, the RStudio IDE has some very nice built-in features that make it much easier to be an R Markdown user."

Again - GO READ her [blogpost](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-05-28-how-i-teach-r-markdown/) for additional links and guides she links to.

My blogpost below is meant to be a sister article to hers, framed with a similar approach we use in Customer Success but different in that we're not doing as much long-form education. Alison's approach is well-informed and very useful in the context of direct teaching activity, which is why I wanted to share it as well!

## How I **share knowledge** around R Markdown

I work on a different team than Alison at RStudio, specifically I'm a Customer Success Manager. This means that I work with existing RStudio Pro Product customers, most often people who have RStudio Connect. I work exclusively with High Tech/Software customers, meaning that they are typically *already* doing very sophisticated work with R in production, and I'm helping them further eliminate friction or empower their data science teams to do more with R.

A core part of my job is **knowledge sharing** around how to use open-source software like R Markdown with or without our Pro Products. Thus most of my work is **Strategic** in nature, although I do often give shorter 30-60 min training sessions that are **Tactical**. 

> A **strategy** is a set of guidelines used to achieve an overall objective, whereas **tactics** are the specific actions aimed at adhering to those guidelines. [Source: Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactic_(method))

Thus my usual framing is covering topics that inform the learner of new strategies (ways of solving a problem) without necessary having to teach all the tactics (nuts and bolts of how it all works).

This post will focus on 4 core strategies of why R Markdown is *SO* useful and absolutely worth learning with links to external tactics/guides/write-ups of how to accomplish the various tasks.

## R Markdown for Literate Programming

**Goal**: Capture code, text/comments, and output in a single document

This is the most common use of R Markdown, and is often how it is taught in University coursework. R Markdown is a tool for [Literate Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), and in summary is:

> A programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.


### MVP of [Reproducibility](https://datacarpentry.org/rr-intro/02-toolkit/)

Whether you talk about **M**inimum **V**iable **P**roduct or **M**ost **V**aluable **P**layer, it works! Since R Markdown is a form of Literate Programming, you can write all of your comments, notes, and execute your code within it.

- R Markdown **HAS** to run successfully to save/knit the output  
- R Markdown is self-documenting (the code is embedded)  
- The code is `diffable` and easily human readable in version control  
- Self-contained workspace

### Exploratory Data Analysis 

An example here is for Dave Robinson's `#TidyTuesday` [screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/user/safe4democracy/playlists) + [code](https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts)  

- Dave uses R Markdown to explore a brand new dataset each week, capturing his comments and train of thought as he tests the data, performs basic analyses, and moves towards a modeling or deliverable data product

## R Markdown as a Data Product

**Goal**: Generate output natively in R for consumption


This is typically the second most common use of R Markdown. Since R Markdown can `knit` to all sorts of different formats, it is a powerful tool for creating data products like:

### [Presentations](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/presentations.html)  
  - Powerpoint  
  - Web-formats - `xaringan` (`remark.js`)  
  - LateX formats - Beamer  
  
### [Dashboards](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) with `flexashboard`  
  - Lets you quickly build beautiful dashboards with either static or reactive components
  
### [Reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html)  
  - Supports HTML Documents, PDF, Word and many others  
  
### [Entire Websites](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/websites.html)  
  - [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for easily extensible custom websites or blogs  
  - [`distill`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) for scientific writing, native to the web (this website is built in `distill`)   
  
Most importantly these formats are created with code, so you get the benefit of reproducibility, automation, etc while still generating data products in the format your non-coder colleagues expect.

## R Markdown as a Control Document

**Goal**: Scale data science tasks, automate the boring stuff, create robust pipelines


Less widely known, but just as important is the idea of R Markdown as a meta-document that lets you bring in other code or automate processes.

As it's much larger in scope than a single bullet point I'd recommend going to read Emily Riederer's blog post on [Rmarkdown Driven Development](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmarkdown-driven-development/). It's "an approach of using R Markdown within the larger scope of the [analysis engineering](https://peerj.com/preprints/3210/) concept" presented by Hilary Parker.

A brief summary of her blogpost:

> I tend to think of each RMarkdown as having a “data product” (an analytical engine calibrated to answer some specific question) nestled within it. Surfacing this tool just requires a touch of forethought before beginning an analysis and a bit of clean-up afterwards.
> 
> In this post, I describe RMarkdown Driven Development: a progression of stages between a single ad-hoc RMarkdown script and more advanced and reusable data products like R projects and packages. This approach has numerous benefits.

### Automation w/ parameters
- Parameters are data passed to the R Markdown document to generate new outputs from the same code.  
- An example here is generating a report for all 50 US states.  
  - Rather than writing 50 reports manually, you can pass a parameter of `state` to the R Markdown report and render 50x reports at once!  
  - The input R Markdown is always the same, but you pass each state as a parameter programatically to generate a new report for EACH state with it's data.  
- [Paramaterized reports](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html)  
- [Parameterized report cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/parameterized-reports.html)  
- [Parameterized Reports site](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/developer_parameterized_reports.html%23parameter_types%2F)  

### Child Documents
- Child documents allow you to bring in OTHER RMarkdown code/documents into a parent, meaning you can use the parent document as a meta-document referencing code/outputs in other documents.  
  - This can greatly help with the flow/size of a single document and you can essentially modularize portions of the document.
  - It's worth noting that you should read Emily's post above on building up a robust R Markdown workflow.
  - [Child Documents](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/child-document.html)  
  - [Child Documents - Yihui's Blog](https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/child/)  

### [RMarkdown for Emails](https://github.com/rich-iannone/blastula) w/ `blastula`  
- While this is technically a data-product, because it is generating an email I'm putting it as a Control Document. The short of this is that `blastula` provides a framework to generate HMTL emails from R Markdown, which are then sent by an email server or RStudio Connect.
  - This [Blastula Webinar](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/avoid-dashboard-fatigue/) covers a lot of the use cases, all with code and real-life applications

### R Markdown + RStudio Connect as an execution engine  
- R Markdown is a first-class citizen on RStudio Connect, and you can interactively generate new reports based on parameters, or schedule R Markdown documents to re-execute documents on a schedule.  

- Code for [ETL](https://solutions.rstudio.com/examples/apps/output-file-etl/) - an example of an ETL process through an automated R Markdown report, this could query against a SQL database or a `spark` cluster to process ETL jobs, all on a schedule down to the minute or up to a year.  
- [Scheduled reporting](https://solutions.rstudio.com/examples/scheduling/scheduling/) - maybe your boss needs a report built every Monday? You can do that too - pulling in new data and re-generating a report on a specific time-schedule all with no need for human intervention. 
- [Emailing w/ `blastula`](https://solutions.rstudio.com/examples/blastula/conditional-example/) - maybe your boss is too busy to consume a full report every day - send a conditional email directly to them if a specific number is hit or missed all with code in R! This email could is built with R Markdown, and could contain plots, tables, raw data, or attach ANY R Markdown-based document (so... basically anything).

## RMarkdown for Templating

**Goal**: Don't repeat yourself, generate **input** templates or **output** documents from code.


Using R Markdown for templating is normally thought of for `knitr::render()` + parameters, but there's additional techniques to solve specific problems that don't fit neatly into paramaterized reports as well.

###  [Knitting w/ `knit::render()`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/reference/render.html)  
- This is the first step towards using a template, and lets you generate R Markdown outputs programatically with code. It can be coupled with parameters or with other arguments for outputs locations, etc.

### Looping outputs 
- This is really still focused at data products, but programmatically building up portions WITHIN a document.
  - In this example, I'm taking a single function and using `purrr::walk()` to generate new outputs from a template within the R Markdown report.
  - Note that for the chunk that outputs the repeated portions, you have to set `results="asis"` in the chunk option.

Minimal example below with the [`palmerpenguins` dataset](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins). I've included the code as an image placed below, as I'm essentially nesting R Markdown chunks inside R Markdown chunks in a R Markdown-based website. Full copy-pastable code at: [https://git.io/JJBcC](https://git.io/JJBcC).

Note that I'm writing one function and calling it `n` times, it would loop across all the data based on the different inputs.


![Loop Code in RMD](loop-code.png)

Which generates the following document:

![Loop Output in RMD](palmer-penguins.png)
  
### [whisker](https://github.com/edwindj/whisker)  
  - `whisker` is a templating engine for R conforming to the Mustache specification.  
  - It uses `glue` style syntax to add data to templates either in memory or to an output file, where my mental model is it is `glue` for documents rather than strings.  
  - You can include templates from all sorts of inputs, like R files, R Markdown, markdown or plain text.  
  - These templates can be local directories, or stored in the [`inst`](https://r-pkgs.org/inst.html) directory of an R package.  
  - Lastly, these can also generate outputs in the same format, eg you can create templates/outputs for R, R Markdown or other plain-text formats!
  
Minimal `whisker` example below:

First, some input data:
```
data <- list(
  name = "Chris", 
  value = 10000, 
  taxed_value = 10000 - (10000 * 0.4), 
  in_ca = TRUE
)

```

Then a template:

```
template <-
'Hello {{name}}
You have just won ${{value}}!
{{#in_ca}}
Well, ${{taxed_value}}, after taxes.
{{/in_ca}}'
```

Now, fill the template!

```
text <- whisker.render(template, data)
cat(text)
```

```
# Output
Hello Chris
You have just won $10000!
Well, $6000, after taxes.
```

I use `whisker` natively to generate the readme files for each week's `#TidyTuesday` submission. Separate blog-post to come for that!

### `usethis::use_template()`

- Alternatively to natively using `whisker` [usethis::use_template()](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_template.html) provides a more ready to use function, and uses `whisker` internally.
  - `use_template()` Used as the engine for a templating function in other packages. 

Sharla Gelfand, the "Queen of Reproducible Reporting", put together lots of material using the `usethis::use_template()` workflow in their work.

- [Sharla Gelfand's `use_template()` blogpost](https://sharla.party/post/usethis-for-reporting/)  
  - In short, they turned an annual report from a mess of copy-pasting and manual work into a fast, streamlined, reproducible, and easily repeatable workflow using R, R Markdown, and `usethis::use_template()`.  
  - [Recording](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/don-t-repeat-yourself-talk-to-yourself-repeated-reporting-in-the-r-universe/) of their presentation on the same topic  
  - [Slides](https://sharstudioconf.netlify.app/) for that presentation.  


### Fin

So that's an overview of my approach to **sharing knowledge** around R Markdown, and like Alison said:

> But remember: there is no one way to learn R Markdown, and no one way to teach it either. I love seeing the creativity of the community when introducing the R Markdown family - so keep them coming!
