We’re also adapting a function from Emil Hvitfeldt to create <img> tags for use by ggtext down the line.\n\n\n# Get QBR data\nqbr_data <- espnscrapeR::get_nfl_qbr(2020)\n\n# Get NFL team data\nteam_data <- espnscrapeR::get_nfl_teams()\n\nall_data <- qbr_data %>% \n  left_join(team_data, by = c(\"team\"  = \"team_short_name\"))\n\nlink_to_img <- function(x, width = 50) {\n  glue::glue(\"<img src='{x}' width='{width}'/>\")\n}\n\n\n\nA quick bar plot of the ranked performance by each QB. We’ve explicilty added colors for each player’s team, and already formatted it for a nice display with some theme changes.\nBasic Plot Code\n\n\nbasic_plot <- all_data %>% \n  mutate(label = link_to_img(headshot_href),\n         rank = as.integer(rank)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(\n      x = rank, y = qbr_total,\n      fill = team_color, color = alternate_color\n      ),\n    width = 0.4\n    ) + \n  scale_color_identity(aesthetics =  c(\"fill\", \"color\")) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1, seq(5, 30, by = 5)), limits = c(0.5, 34)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = \"QBR\\n\",\n       title = \"QBR - 2020 Season\",\n       subtitle = \"Weeks: 1-4\",\n       caption = \"<br>**Data:** espnscrapeR | **Plot:** @thomas_mock\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"Chivo\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 20),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16),\n    plot.caption = element_markdown(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\")\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s a fine plot, but unless we’re very knowledgeable about team colors you probably can’t decide which player/team belongs to each column. Now, we could approach it a different way, and rather than plotting ranks we can flip the graph where QBR is on the X, and player name is on the Y, now explicitly sorting by rank.\nSideways Plot Code\n\n\nside_plot <- all_data %>% \n  mutate(label = link_to_img(headshot_href),\n         rank = as.integer(rank)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(\n      x = qbr_total, y = fct_reorder(name, qbr_total),\n      fill = team_color, color = alternate_color\n      ),\n    width = 0.4\n    ) + \n  scale_color_identity(aesthetics =  c(\"fill\", \"color\")) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +\n  labs(x = \"\\nQBR\",\n       y = NULL,\n       title = \"QBR - 2020 Season\",\n       subtitle = \"Weeks: 1-4\",\n       caption = \"<br>**Data:** espnscrapeR | **Plot:** @thomas_mock\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"Chivo\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 20),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16),\n    plot.caption = element_markdown(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = -25, unit = \"pt\")),\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain that’s a useful plot, but we often want to include some more pizzazz by including team logos or player headshots. Below we’ll cover a few of the ways to do this, and some of the barriers or pain points we’ll run into along the way!\nggimage\nFirst we have ggimage + end of column labels. I also want to note that I’m explicitly showing the code here, and using tictoc to display how long saving these images will take. In general, displaying embedded images is a bit slower than an equivalent basic ggplot. Since I want to show what the images will look like after export, I’m also using knitr::include_graphics() to include the actual exported PNG in this RMarkdown-based website. I’ve also included tictoc for how long each code-section took to save so you can see that each method is about 5-8 seconds.\nNOTE: I realise this graphic is distorted, it’s an intentional display of a problem you may run into\n\n\ntic()\nqb_col_img <- basic_plot +\n  geom_image(\n    aes(\n      x = rank, y = qbr_total,\n      image = headshot_href\n      )\n    )\n\n# Not displaying the image directly, \n# but reading in the exported img after\n# qb_col_img\n\n# saving it as a rectangle\nggsave(\n  \"qbr-ggimage.png\", qb_col_img, \n  height = 10, width = 16, dpi = \"retina\"\n  )\n\ntoc()\n\n\n10.718 sec elapsed\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that since we have a rectangle-shaped graph, the images have been distorted to be wider than they should. Now if you want the images to come out without being distorted, you need to specify the specific aspect ratio you’re using. Just in case you haven’t heard of an aspect ratio, I’ll also provide a definition as the ratio of width to height.\nggimage and Aspect Ratio\nNote that geom_image() has the following parameters:\ngeom_image(\n  mapping = NULL,\n  data = NULL,\n  stat = \"identity\",\n  position = \"identity\",\n  inherit.aes = TRUE,\n  na.rm = FALSE,\n  by = \"width\",\n  nudge_x = 0,\n  ...\n)\nThere isn’t an explicit option for aspect ratio, but it exists as asp. So if we consider ahead of time the dimensions of the plot we want to make, we can define the aspect ratio at the plot level and at the ggsave level. Per some experiments on Windows specifically, we also need to include aspect ratio in the theme() call as well, and make sure this again aligns with your ggsave() call.\n\n\n# Define an aspect ratio to use throughout\n# This value is the golden ratio\n# which provides a wider than tall rectangle\nasp_ratio <- 1.618 \n\ntic()\nqb_col_img_asp <- basic_plot +\n  # note we can also control the size of the image according to it's width\n  geom_image(\n    aes(\n      x = rank, y = qbr_total,\n      image = headshot_href\n      ), \n    # Set size, and aspect ratio\n    size = 0.05, by = \"width\", asp = asp_ratio\n    ) +\n  # Second step\n  theme(aspect.ratio = 1/asp_ratio)\n\n# include aspect ratio in ggsave\nggsave(\n  \"qbr-img-asp.png\", qb_col_img_asp, \n  # make the width equivalent to the aspect.ratio\n  height = 10, width = 10 * asp_ratio, dpi = \"retina\"\n  )\ntoc()\n\n\n5.889 sec elapsed\n\n\n\n\nWhile this may seem like a bit of work, it’s a good habit to think explicitly about what size or ratio you want to save your plots out as (it can inform how big to make your text amongst other things).\nHowever, there’s an even easier way thanks to ggtext!\nggtext + column end labels.\nNext we have ggtext + column labels. Here ggtext::geom_richtext() handles the proper scaling of the image without really any intervention from us! While geom_richtext() is very useful we’re sort of using it out of its normal context. The overall purpose of ggtext is to provide “improved text rendering support for ggplot2”. The ggtext site has all the capabilities and function details. In short, ggtext provides a limited subset of markdown/HTML/CSS syntax as an interface to changing text in ggplot2.\nThus, to achieve our goal of embedding images, we can create an img HTML tag to embed an image rather than just format text. Note that again, while this looks like a HTML call it works anywhere you want to use ggplot2. Credit to Emil Hvitfeldt for the idea of using an img tag and the function we’re adapting to embed images.\n\n\n# Don't forget, we already created an img label column with HTML\nlink_to_img <- function(x, width = 50) {\n  glue::glue(\"<img src='{x}' width='{width}'/>\")\n}\n\n\n\n\n\ntic()\nqb_col_text <- basic_plot + \n    geom_richtext(\n      aes(x = rank, y = qbr_total, label = label), \n      size = 1,\n      fill = NA, label.color = NA, # remove background and outline\n      label.padding = grid::unit(rep(0, 4), \"pt\") # remove padding\n      )\n\nggsave(\"qbr-ggtext.png\", qb_col_text, height = 10, width = 10 * asp_ratio, dpi = \"retina\")\ntoc()\n\n\n7.227 sec elapsed\n\n\n\n\nggtext + Axis Labels\nNow we could also change the images on the x-axis w/ the code below, and note that we’re mainly taking the same code, but changing the core aes() call to have x = label and axis.text.x = ggtext::element_markdown() - full details shown below.\n\n\n# Here are the parts we're changing\n\n# change x-axis to be the label we've created\naes(x = fct_reorder(label, qbr_total, .desc = TRUE))\n\n# and changing the theme to include element_markdown()\ntheme(\n  axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n  # add element_markdown to axis.text.x\n  # this will parse the labels to add img\n  axis.text.x = element_markdown(margin = margin(t = -25, unit = \"pt\"))\n  )\n\n\n\nHere’s the full code of the call with again some highlighted portions where we’ve changed code.\n\n\ntic()\naxis_plot <- basic_plot <- all_data %>% \n  mutate(label = link_to_img(headshot_href),\n         rank = as.integer(rank)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(\n      ## CHANGE IS HERE ##\n      # apply label to x axis labels\n      x = fct_reorder(label, qbr_total, .desc = TRUE), \n      y = qbr_total,\n      fill = team_color, color = alternate_color\n      ),\n    width = 0.4\n    ) + \n  scale_color_identity(aesthetics =  c(\"fill\", \"color\")) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"black\", size = 1) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +\n  labs(x = NULL,\n       y = \"QBR\\n\",\n       title = \"QBR - 2020 Season\",\n       subtitle = \"Weeks: 1-4\",\n       caption = \"<br>**Data:** espnscrapeR | **Plot:** @thomas_mock\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"Chivo\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 20),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16),\n    plot.caption = element_markdown(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\")\n    ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),\n    # add element_markdown to axis.text.x\n    # this will parse the labels to add img\n    # we're also decreasing the margin so that the logos/heads are close \n    # to the columns\n    axis.text.x = element_markdown(margin = margin(t = -25, unit = \"pt\"))\n    )\n\n# axis_plot\n\nggsave(\n  \"qbr-axis-img.png\", axis_plot, \n  height = 10, width = 10 * asp_ratio, dpi = \"retina\"\n  )\ntoc()\n\n\n7.817 sec elapsed\n\n\n\n\nggtext Negatives\nOK wow, so why not just use ggtext all the time!?\nCons:\nIt’s verrrrrrry slow to draw in the RStudio plot-viewer, like on the order of a few minutes with 33 embedded images, however it will still save to png in a few seconds\nCan’t adjust size in ggplot - has to be done ahead of time w/ HTML syntax in our custom function\nI’m fine with these tradeoffs, as you can still ggsave it in a few seconds and you don’t have to worry about the scaling.\nWhat about a table?\nSo a slight hot-take is that since we’re showing values that we’re inherently asking people to look up and compare individual values (ie find your QB of interest vs the field), this should be a table!\nPer Stephen Few:\n\nTables: Display used to look up and compare individual values.\n\n\nGraph: Used to display the relationship among whole sets of values and their overall shape.\n\nNow sure, we’re showing a shape of the graphic, but really this is a way to show how far ahead (or behind) one player is behind another which is comparing individual values. That being said, I think it’s totally fine to use this a graphic, it’s attractive, people seem to enjoy them, and everyone has the free will to make their own graph/table decisions!\nBelow is an example of a table that occupies roughly the same space, tells the same story, uses the same headshots, but also adds more data in QB run vs pass EPA splits along with total plays.\nTable Data + Function\n\n\ntab_data <- all_data %>% \n  mutate(RK = rank(desc(qbr_total)),\n         RK = as.integer(RK)) %>% \n  select(RK, name, headshot_href, qbr_total, qb_plays, pass, run) \n\ntab_function <- function(data, ...){\n  data %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  text_transform(\n    locations = cells_body(vars(headshot_href)),\n    fn = function(x){\n      web_image(\n        url = x,\n        height = px(30)\n      )\n    }\n  ) %>% \n  cols_label(\n    headshot_href = \"\",\n    name = \"Name\",\n    qbr_total = \"QBR\",\n    qb_plays = \"Plays\",\n    run = \"Run\",\n    pass = \"Pass\"\n  ) %>% \n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(qbr_total),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\"#af8dc3\", \"#f7f7f7\", \"#7fbf7b\"),\n      domain = c(25, 100)\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(weight = \"bold\"),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      columns = vars(RK, name)\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  tab_options(\n    column_labels.background.color = \"white\",\n    column_labels.font.weight = \"bold\",\n    table.border.top.width = px(3),\n    table.border.top.color = \"transparent\",\n    table.border.bottom.color = \"transparent\",\n    table.border.bottom.width = px(3),\n    column_labels.border.top.width = px(3),\n    column_labels.border.top.color = \"transparent\",\n    column_labels.border.bottom.width = px(3),\n    column_labels.border.bottom.color = \"black\",\n    data_row.padding = px(3),\n    source_notes.font.size = 12,\n    table.font.size = 16,\n    heading.align = \"left\",\n    ...\n  ) %>%\n  opt_table_font(\n    font = list(\n      google_font(\"Chivo\"),\n      default_fonts()\n    )\n  ) \n\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe code uses the function defined in the above expandable section, and to get the side-by-side format I decided to save the tables as PNG and then combine with magick::image_append().\n\n\ntab_data %>% \n  slice(1:17) %>% \n  tab_function()\n\ntab_data %>% \n  slice(178:nrow(.)) %>% \n  tab_function() %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style = cell_borders(\n      sides = \"left\",\n      color = \"black\",\n      weight = px(3)\n    ),\n    locations = \n      list(\n        cells_body(\n          columns = 1\n        ),\n        cells_column_labels(1)\n      )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nimg1 <- magick::image_read(\"gt-tab1.png\")\nimg2 <- magick::image_read(\"gt-tab2.png\")\n\nmagick::image_append(c(img1, img2))\n\n\n\n\nThe equivalent plot that displays:\n- Run EPA\n- Pass EPA\n- QBR\n- Player name\nWe’ve also loaded the ggrepel package to add labels. This graphic is getting a bit busy at this point but is still useful. Given that we’re trying to display 4 measures we have had to rely on size for run EPA which adds additional overhead to the understanding of this graphic as well.\n\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\nscatter_plot <- all_data %>% \n  mutate(label = link_to_img(headshot_href),\n         rank = as.integer(rank)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_smooth(aes(x = pass, y = qbr_total), method = \"lm\", color = \"grey\") +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(\n    aes(x = pass, y = qbr_total, label = last_name),\n    box.padding = 0.5, fontface = \"bold\", size = 6\n    ) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(x = pass, y = qbr_total, size = run, fill = team_color, color = alternate_color), \n    shape = 21\n    ) +\n  scale_color_identity(aesthetics =  c(\"fill\", \"color\")) +\n  scale_size(name = \"Run EPA\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10), limits = c(0, 100)) +\n  labs(x = \"\\nPass Expected Points Added\",\n       y = \"QBR\\n\",\n       title = \"QBR - 2020 Season\",\n       subtitle = \"Weeks: 1-4\\nNote that Pass EPA is predictive of QBR\",\n       caption = \"<br>**Data:** espnscrapeR | **Plot:** @thomas_mock\") +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(family = \"Chivo\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 20),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 16),\n    plot.caption = element_markdown(size = 12),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = c(0.1,0.9),\n    legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightgrey\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n    )\n\nscatter_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Ready to share an update on the top 10 QBs by QBR for week 1, or week 2 or week 3, or week 16 from 2015, or ANY other week/season combo! Putting this all into a function lets us simply focus on which data to input and generate a nice table.\nNote you could still do a lot to this table to get it publication ready or specific to your “brand”, which gets us into the next part - themes!\ngt Themes\nWe’re going to explore 3 different formats for elegant tables with examples from ESPN, ProFootball Focus, and FiveThirtyEight. Of the three, I personally think that FiveThirtyEight has some of the best minimalist tables on the web right now, but for the sake of different tastes we’ll go through each!\nBefore diving right into the themes - I’d first like to show a quick example of a theme and walk through the code. Hopefully this gives you enough to make your own themes down the line!\nYou can think of gt themes in a similar fashion to ggplot2 themes. Just as theme_bw() just changes the appearance (eg theme) of the plot, a custom-defined gt theme will affect the overall appearance of a gt table (although as a function you could make it do even more!).\n\n\nmtcars %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  # Here is a built in theme for ggplot2\n  theme_bw()\n\n\nBasic Theme\nThe core idea of a theme is that it’s a function that passes data and ..., where the data is actually a gt object, and the ... are a placeholder for user-defined expressions. The ... can also be called “dot-dot-dot”, “the dots” or “ellipsis”, and you can read more about them in the Tidy evaluation book. A quick quote about them from that book chapter:\n\nThe dot-dot-dot argument is one of the nicest aspects of the R language. A function that takes ... accepts any number of arguments, named or unnamed.\n\nWhat this really means is that we are leaving any argument on the table for tab_options() which has the widest range of possible arguments in gt (> 100 possible arguments). You can see all the possible options in the gt reference.\nOur basic example passes data as the first argument into tab_options() and leaves a ... inside tab_options().\n\n\nbasic_theme <- function(data, ...){\n  data %>% \n    tab_options(\n      table.background.color = \"purple\",\n      ...\n    )\n}\n\nIf we use this theme, it will just change the table background color.\n\n\nmtcars %>% \n  head() %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  basic_theme()\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira

again using the original QBR data, and they are clean and simple. All caps on the column labels, row striping, but also add the player’s team as smaller gray text after the player’s name. Note that they also use hyperlinks to the player page (I’ll just focus on showing an example of blue text). Lastly, ESPN also uses interactive tables so there is a highlighted column for sorting. I’ll cover reactable themes on a later date so for now we’ll focus on static HTML with gt.\n\n\n\n\n\nESPN Table\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Code\n\n\nespn_qbr <- espnscrapeR::get_nfl_qbr(2020) %>% \n  select(\n    rk = rank, team, name, qbr = qbr_total, paa = points_added, plays = qb_plays,\n    epa = total_epa, pass, run, sack, pen = penalty, raw = raw_qbr\n    )\n\nespn_qbr %>% \n  mutate(name = paste0(\n    \"<span style='font-size:16px; color:royalblue;'>\",\n    name,\n    \"<\/span>\",\n    \" <span style='font-size:12px; color:grey;'>\",\n    word(team, start = -1), \"<\/span>\"),\n    name = map(name, ~gt::html(as.character(.x)))\n  ) %>%\n  select(-team) %>% \n  slice(1:15) %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  tab_header(title = md(\"**NFL Total QBR - 2020 Season Leaders**\")) %>% \n  gt_theme_espn() %>% \n  cols_align(\"left\", columns = vars(name)) %>% \n  tab_source_note(md(\"**Data:** ESPN<br>**Table:** @thomas_mock\"))\n\n\n\nTheme Code\n\n\ngt_theme_espn <- function(data, ...){\n  data %>% \n    opt_all_caps()  %>%\n    opt_table_font(\n      font = list(\n        google_font(\"Lato\"),\n        default_fonts()\n      )\n    )  %>% \n    opt_row_striping() %>% \n    tab_options(\n      row.striping.background_color = \"#fafafa\",\n      table_body.hlines.color = \"#f6f7f7\",\n      source_notes.font.size = 12,\n      table.font.size = 16,\n      table.width = px(700),\n      heading.align = \"left\",\n      heading.title.font.size = 24,\n      table.border.top.color = \"transparent\",\n      table.border.top.width = px(3),\n      data_row.padding = px(7),\n      ...\n    ) \n}\n\n\n\nPFF\nThe data for this example is FAKE example data for some edge defenders.

Example from their Position Grade data.\nThere’s a few things of interest we want to do to:\n- Row striping without horizontal lines\n- Dark gray column labels background (but light gray for spanners) and all caps labels\n- Team logos\n- Bold text for PFF grade, but normal weights for snap counts\n\n\nPFF-themed Table\n\n\n\n\n\nPFF Example\n\n\n\n\n\nTable Code\n\n\nfake_df %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  fmt_number(\n    columns = 6:9,\n    decimals = 1\n    ) %>% \n  gt_theme_pff()\n\n\n\nTheme Code\n\n\ngt_theme_pff <- function(data, ...) {\n  data %>%\n    # Add team logos w/ web_image\n    text_transform(\n      locations = cells_body(\n        vars(logo)\n      ),\n      fn = function(x) {\n        web_image(\n          url = x,\n          height = 25\n        )\n      }\n    ) %>%\n    # add spanner for PFF Grade\n    tab_spanner(\n      label = \"PFF GRADE\",\n      columns = vars(def, rdef, prush, cov)\n    ) %>%\n    # add spanner for SNAPS\n    tab_spanner(\n      label = \"SNAPS\",\n      columns = contains(\"snaps\")\n    ) %>%\n    # Add a \"blank\" spanner to add white space\n    tab_spanner(\n      label = \"BLANK\",\n      columns = 1:5\n    ) %>%\n    # Relabel columns\n    cols_label(\n      def_snaps = \"DEF\",\n      rdef_snaps = \"RDEF\",\n      prush_snaps = \"PRUSH\",\n      cov_snaps = \"COV\",\n      number = \"#\",\n      logo = \"\"\n    ) %>%\n    # if missing, replace NA w/ ---\n    fmt_missing(\n      columns = everything(),\n      missing_text = \"---\"\n    ) %>%\n    # add exact color from PFF table to spanners\n    tab_style(\n      style = list(\n        cell_fill(color = \"#e4e8ed\"),\n        cell_text(color = \"#878e94\"),\n        cell_borders(sides = \"left\", color = \"white\", weight = px(3))\n      ),\n      locations = list(\n        cells_column_spanners(\n          spanners = c(\"PFF GRADE\", \"SNAPS\")\n        )\n      )\n    ) %>%\n    # hide spanner with transparent color\n    tab_style(\n      style = list(\n        cell_fill(color = \"transparent\"),\n        cell_text(color = \"transparent\")\n      ),\n      locations = list(\n        cells_column_spanners(\n          spanners = c(\"BLANK\")\n        )\n      )\n    ) %>%\n    # Change font color and weight for numeric col\n    tab_style(\n      style = list(\n        cell_text(color = \"#3a3d42\", weight = \"bold\")\n      ),\n      locations = cells_body(\n        columns = 5:9\n      )\n    ) %>%\n    # Add pound sign in front of numbers\n    text_transform(\n      locations = cells_body(\n        columns = vars(number)\n      ),\n      fn = function(x) {\n        paste0(\"#\", x)\n      }\n    ) %>%\n    # Make column labels and spanners all caps\n    opt_all_caps() %>%\n    # add row striping\n    opt_row_striping() %>%\n    # change overall table styling for borders and striping\n    tab_options(\n      column_labels.background.color = \"#585d63\",\n      table_body.hlines.color = \"transparent\",\n      table.border.top.width = px(3),\n      table.border.top.color = \"transparent\",\n      table.border.bottom.color = \"transparent\",\n      table.border.bottom.width = px(3),\n      column_labels.border.top.width = px(3),\n      column_labels.border.top.color = \"transparent\",\n      column_labels.border.bottom.width = px(3),\n      column_labels.border.bottom.color = \"transparent\",\n      row.striping.background_color = \"#f9f9fb\",\n      data_row.padding = px(3),\n      ...\n    ) %>%\n    cols_width(\n      1 ~ px(75),\n      2 ~ px(125),\n      3 ~ px(30),\n      4 ~ px(40),\n      everything() ~ px(60)\n    ) %>% \n    # change color of border separating the text from the sourcenote\n    tab_style(\n      style = cell_borders(\n        sides = \"bottom\", color = \"#585d63\", weight = px(2)\n      ),\n      locations = cells_body(\n        columns = TRUE,\n        rows = nrow(data$`_data`)\n      )\n    ) %>%\n    # change font to Lato throughout (note no need to have Lato locally!)\n    opt_table_font(\n      font = c(\n        google_font(name = \"Lato\"),\n        default_fonts()\n      )\n    ) %>%\n    # add source note\n    tab_source_note(\n      source_note = md(\"**Data:** _FAKE DATA_ Pro Football Focus<br>**Table:** @thomas_mock\")\n    )\n}\n\n\n\nWhile this theme is great, it’s very tailored to this specific data, so it’s closer to a function to generate PFF defensive grade tables. This is fine, as it would greatly speed up the ability to generate these for sharing somewhere, but it’s not a very generic function that could be used for novel data structures. This is mainly as we are doing some sneaky things to get the grey boxes around PFF GRADE and SNAPS that involve transparent backgrounds at specific locations. You could adapt big chunks of this code to use elsewhere though, and note that it would still work for CBs, LBs, Edge, DL, and Safeties. That’s pretty useful!\nFiveThirtyEight\nNow, since FiveThirtyEight tables are more minimal, the theme we’ll use for those tables can be essentially be extended to almost any table! The original data and table come from a FiveThirtyEight article from 2018.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal\n\n\n\nTable Code\n\n\nlibrary(rvest)\n\nurl <- \"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sorry-running-backs-even-your-receiving-value-can-be-easily-replaced/\"\n\nrb_receiving <- url %>% \n  xml2::read_html() %>% \n  rvest::html_table() %>% \n  purrr::chuck(1) %>% \n  purrr::set_names(nm = c(\"team\", \"attempts\", \"successful\", \"success_rate\")) %>% \n  dplyr::as_tibble() %>% \n  filter(team != \"team\") %>% \n  mutate(success_rate = stringr::str_remove(success_rate, \"%\")) %>% \n  mutate(across(c(attempts:success_rate), as.double))\n\n\n\ntab_538 <- rb_receiving %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  tab_spanner(\n    label = \"PASSES TO RBS\",\n    columns = vars(attempts, successful)\n  ) %>% \n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(success_rate),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n      palette = c(\"white\", \"#3fc1c9\"),\n      domain = NULL\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  cols_label(\n    success_rate = \"SUCCESS RATE (%)\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"SOURCE: ESPN STATS & INFORMATION GROUP<br>TABLE: @THOMAS_MOCK\")\n  ) %>% \n  gt_theme_538(table.width = px(550))\n\nTheme Code\nHere’s the theme code for the FiveThirtyEight theme.\n\n\ngt_theme_538 <- function(data,...) {\n  data %>%\n  opt_all_caps()  %>%\n  opt_table_font(\n    font = list(\n      google_font(\"Chivo\"),\n      default_fonts()\n    )\n  ) %>%\n    tab_style(\n      style = cell_borders(\n        sides = \"bottom\", color = \"transparent\", weight = px(2)\n      ),\n      locations = cells_body(\n        columns = TRUE,\n        # This is a relatively sneaky way of changing the bottom border\n        # Regardless of data size\n        rows = nrow(data$`_data`)\n      )\n    )  %>% \n  tab_options(\n    column_labels.background.color = \"white\",\n    table.border.top.width = px(3),\n    table.border.top.color = \"transparent\",\n    table.border.bottom.color = \"transparent\",\n    table.border.bottom.width = px(3),\n    column_labels.border.top.width = px(3),\n    column_labels.border.top.color = \"transparent\",\n    column_labels.border.bottom.width = px(3),\n    column_labels.border.bottom.color = \"black\",\n    data_row.padding = px(3),\n    source_notes.font.size = 12,\n    table.font.size = 16,\n    heading.align = \"left\",\n    ...\n  ) \n}\n\n\nNow, since that data is public via nflfastR, we could try and recreate that table for 2018 or 2019 (or really any year between 1999 and 2020).

Here's a thread summarizing the 10 guidelines. Full paper is here: https://t.co/VSGYnfg7iP pic.twitter.com/W6qbsktioL\n\n— Jon Schwabish (@jschwabish) August 3, 2020\n\nAfter seeing Jon’s Twitter thread, I asked him if I could adapt the examples over to R. He graciously agreed, so I’ve gone ahead and adapted some examples from his 10 Guidelines article 1 below in the R package gt. Jon also has a Better Data Visualizations book coming out in Jan 2021 - check it out at Columbia University Press.\nPlease note that the 10 Guidelines section headers are quoted verbatim from Jon’s article (after asking permission), while the tables themselves and text descriptions are original content inspired from his work.\n10 Rules for Tables\n- Twitter Thread - In this thread, Jon covers the highpoints of each of the 10 guidelines\n- 10 Guidelines in the Journal of Benefit Cost Analysis - In this article, Jon dives even deeper into the WHY and longer explanations of the guidelines, along with some best practice examples\nCole Nussbaumer Knaflic\nThe Storytelling with Data community (#SWDchallenge) is hosting a “Build a Table” challenge for September 2020. Check out the resources below and try your hand to create some beautiful tables!\n\nFind some data of interest that will lend itself well and create and share a table.\nShare your creation in the SWD community by September 30th at 5PM PDT. If there is any specific feedback or input that you would find helpful, include that detail in your commentary.\n\nStephen Few\nI also have some overview examples from Stephen Few’s book Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten. In my opinion, Stephen Few’s Show Me the Numbers 2 is one of the best if not the best general books on both data visualization and data tables. There are more recent books on data viz, but very few address tables at all, much less with the depth that Few does! I am barely scratching the surface of what Stephen and Jon cover - so make sure to check out their resources!\nFew summarizes the difference between Tables and Graphs:\n> Tables: Display used to look up and compare individual values\n> Graphs: Display used to reveal relationships among whole sets of values and their overall shape\nWhen to use each\nHe further suggests when to use which

Show Me the Numbers: Designing Tables and Graphs to Enlighten.(4)57\n    \n\nThis table thus separates Data Viz and Data Tables into their specific purposes, however like most rules you can bend these with creative use.\nTaxonomy of table uses\nWhile that’s helpful, I also think that his taxonomy of the Primary Function, Relationship Type, and Relationship are extremely useful for determining the purpose of your table. Similar to data viz it’s all too easy to simply throw data into a table and not think about how to improve its function. I’ve adapted his taxonomy and added my own examples with the #TidyTuesday dataset from week 36 of 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this taxonomy you can specifically choose what you purpose/function you are giving the table. Again, it’s important to not just throw data into a tabular format and call it a day, but rather make specific design decisions to help guide the reader towards the purpose of the table. All too often we do all the heavy lifting to clean, summarize, and model the data only to let our readers down by not preparing a useful final data product.\nWe should be making conscious decisions:\nWhat is the Primary Function of this table?\nHow is the data related?\nHow can I best present the data relationships to accomplish the primary function?\nCan I improve the readability?\nCan I reduce repetition?\nCan I guide the reader to use the table in a better way?\ngt: A Grammar of Tables\ngt is again, an R package to create tables in R. It provides a Grammar of Tables to turn tabular data into a proper table!\nWhile gt is fantastic, I also greatly enjoy other table packages in R:\n- kableExtra - great for HTML/LaTex\n- formattable - great for custom fill of cells and HTML\n- DT or reactable - great for reactive tables\n- flextable - A very useful package for Word-based tables\nAdditionally - if your primary output is model summaries rather than data tables, make sure to check out the wonderful gtsummary R package which extends the gt package for statistical model summaries. Note that while it uses gt, it also further supports kable, kableExtra, flextable (for Word docs), and tibble methods.\nThe “grammar” of tables can be seen below.\nDiagram of the parts of a tableWith this as our starting point, we can use code to add specific portions and change the overall structure and appearance of the tables.\n\n\n\nBasic gt Table\nYou can create a table by passing in data to gt(), and the idea is that you progressively add layers/changes to the gt table via the pipe.\n\n\n# This works!\n# gt(yield_data_wide)\n\n# pipe also works!\nyield_data_wide %>% \n  gt()\nhtml {\n

Notice I’m also using fmt_number() to decrease the decimal point precision of the numbers. It will default to 2 decimal places, although you can specify whatever number of decimals you want. You may also notice that I referenced the columns by position in fmt_number(), but used tidy-eval w/ vars() in summary_rows(). You can always fall back to either method!\n\n\nyield_data_wide %>% \n  mutate(crop = str_to_title(crop)) %>% \n  group_by(crop) %>% \n  gt(\n    rowname_col = \"Country\"\n  ) %>% \n  fmt_number(\n

Note that this is our first use of the locations argument. Locations is used with things like cells_column_labels() or cells_body(), cells_summary() to offer very tight control of where to place certain changes. While you can still reference columns by position, note that I use 1:3 here instead of 2:5 since I’m referencing just the column labels. You can again use vars(name) instead of position.\n\n\nyield_data_wide %>% \n  head() %>%\n  gt(\n    groupname_col = \"crop\",\n    rowname_col = \"Country\"\n  ) %>% \n  tab_footnote(\n    footnote

You’ll notice that it’s VERY easy and quick to build up the bulk of a gt table, but you can also spend 2-3x the amount of code to add all sorts of little tweaks and customizations. Saving some of these tweaks as a “theme” can save you lots of repeated code calls!\n\n\nmy_theme <- function(data) {\n  tab_options(\n    data = data,\n    heading.subtitle.font.size = 12,\n

specific cell, you’ll want to use tab_style(), note that you can reference specific types of changes in the style, and by wrapping it in a list as seen below you can make multiple changes at a time. You are limited to one set of locations however.\nLocations can take column/row by position (eg columns = 1, rows = c(5:6)) or with columns by name via vars(col_name). Lastly, you can use logical expressions in rows = to match certain criteria to assign a style. Here I’m assigning red italics to China’s crop outputs only with the following code: rows = Country == \"China\".\n\n\nyield_data_wide %>% \n  head() %>%\n  gt() %>% \n  tab_style(\n    style =

of a dataviz style color gradient rather than assigning colors one at a time, you can use data_color() along with something like scales::col_numeric(). Note that I’m using paletteer to provide the palette, but you can also provide your own palette. Also - domain could be specified for a specific range, otherwise it will fit the colors to whatever range is present in the data.\n\n\nyield_data_wide %>% \n  head() %>%\n  gt(\n    groupname_col =

for the basics of gt! Now, let’s dive into Jon Schwabish’s “10 Guidelines for Better Tables” where we can apply some of these techniques to some table examples.\n10 Guidelines with gt\nThe core data comes from #TidyTuesday week 36 of 2020. Let’s load up the data and clean it up a bit. We’ll be using portions of this data throughout.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2020, \"36\")\n\n\n\ncountry_sel <- c(\"China\", \"India\", \"United States\", \"Indonesia\", \"Mexico\", \"Pakistan\")\n\nyield_data <- tuesdata$key_crop_yields %>% \n  janitor::clean_names() %>% \n  rename_with(~str_remove(., \"_tonnes_per_hectare\")) %>% \n  select(entity:beans, -code) %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = wheat:beans, names_to = \"crop\", values_to = \"yield\") %>% \n  rename(Country = entity)\n\nRule 1: Offset the Heads from the Body\nThe goal here is to clearly separate your column titles from the body of the table. Typically bold face, separator lines indicate categories/labels (column titles) from values (table body).\nFirst we can prep the data to align with the examples.\n\n\n# data prep\npotato_data <- yield_data %>% \n  filter(Country %in% country_sel, crop == \"potatoes\", year %in% c(2013:2016)) %>% \n  filter(crop == \"potatoes\") %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = \"yield\")\n\n1. Poor Example\nRule 1 | Poor example gt code \n\n\npotato_tb <- potato_data %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  cols_hide(vars(crop)) %>% \n  opt_table_lines(extent = \"none\") %>% \n  fmt_number(\n    columns = 3:6,\n    decimals = 2\n  )\n\n\n\npotato_tb\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans', 'Droid Sans',

Addendums to alignment\nWhen aligning text of equal length (long or very short), center alignment of text can be fine or even preferable. For example, very short text with a long header can be better suited to center-align. Equal length text can be centered without negatively affecting the ability to quickly read.\n\n\nrule3_data_addendum <- yield_data %>% \n  filter(\n    Country %in% c(\"Africa\"), \n    year >= 2015,\n    str_length(crop) == 5\n    ) %>%\n  group_by(year) %>% \n  mutate(\n    crop = str_to_title(crop),\n    max_yield = max(yield),\n    `Top Crop` = if_else(yield == max_yield, \"Y\", \"N\")\n    ) %>%\n  select(Year = year, Crop = crop, `Top Crop`, Yield = yield) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\nWhile the table below could be improved in other ways and has quite a bit of repetition, note that the Top Crop column has too much white space on the right side due to defaulting to left-alignment. This makes it “stick” too much to the adjacent column.\n\n\nrule3_data_addendum %>% \n  gt()\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell,

makes it easier to visually parse the column, and note that centering the Crop Column has no negative effect on the alignment or ability to read as each cell value has equal length (as long as the font-choice is one that doesn’t have major differenceds in charater width). The left-alignment rule for text is a good default, but is more effective with variable width text especially with large variation (ie length = 10 interspersed with length = 5).\n\n\nrule3_data_addendum %>% \n  gt() %>% \n  gt::cols_align(\n    align = \"center\",\n    columns = vars(`Top Crop`, Crop)\n  )\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe

and Columns\nWhile there is a bit of art to the science of spacing - think of how you want to guide the reader. You want to make it easy to move horizontally and/or vertically depending on the purpose of the table. Additionally, increasing spacing can improve the overall readability of the table although TOO much space can be distracting.\nRule 6 | Table Spacing gt code \n\n\nrule6_data <- yield_data %>% \n

table. For our example, we are dropping the % sign after the first appearance. While this is easy to do with currency symbols at the start of the row, the % sign at the end alters the alignment of the cells. gt actually has an open Github Issue to allow for this feature, but in the meantime I have two strategies to accomplish the % trick as seen below.\n\n\nrule6_tb %>% \n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = 2:4,\n    rows = 1,\n    scale_values = FALSE\n  ) %>% \n

Sparklines\nFor example one we can use sparklines to indicate trends across time. There’s quite a bit of code below, and we actually use two datasets. Since we are creating the sparklines outside of gt make sure to align the graphs + data as gt doesn’t control the overall relationship. For example, if you arrange() by a specific column you’ll need to make sure to do it across both datasets.\nRule 10 | Sparkline example gt code \n\n\nplot_spark <- function(data){\n  data %>% \n

Barplot\nFor this example we can use barplots to indicate the average across the 5 years. Note that rather than building a ggplot for each of the rows, we can take some influence from the formattable R package and create a bar with just HTML/CSS! There’s quite a bit of code below, but note that the gt package requires you to parse the HTML with gt::html(). Overall this method is “cleaner” than via ggplot as you are mutating columns within the same dataset, and it’s much faster since you are just parsing HTML rather than creating, saving, and importing several ggplot images.\nMany thanks to the formattable author Renkun Kun and others like rtjohnson12 who have shown examples about how to build up a bar chart with HTML! Thanks also to Christophe Dervieux for a great example of gt + custom HTML on RStudio Community.\nRule 10 | Barplot example gt code \n\n\n# Example of using glue to just paste the value into

We renamed our column summaries to just Avg. and Avg. - we can assume that the reader understands it is the summary of the columns to their immediate left, but it can be helpful to also explicitly tell the reader what the calculation is. What if the second Avg. was in fact the average from all years (2007 to 2016), rather than just 2012 through 2016?\n\n\nrule2_tab2 %>% \n  tab_source_note(md(\"**Table**: @thomas_mock | **Data**:

Well, we run the risk of overplotting by graphing just the points without thinking or adjusting any of the aesthetics.\nHadley Wickham in ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis:\n\nWhen the data is large, points will be often plotted on top of each other, obscuring the true relationship. In extreme cases, you will only be able to see the extent of the data, and any conclusions drawn from the graphic will be suspect. This problem is called overplotting.\n\nHadley uses an example with just 2000 data points, which already has a lot of overplotting due to a small sample x-y space. We have about 43,000 passes for this dataset, spread out over a relatively large space. We still need to be careful of overplotting though!\nData to Viz and Clause Wilke have good writeups on overplotting as well\nClaus Wilke | Fundamentals of Data Visualization3 \nWhile it’s not really focused on the problem at hand, Claus Wilke has a wonderful book on the Fundaments of Data Visualization. His chapters below are applicable and very helpful for best practices:\nVisualizing Distributions - Histograms and density plots\nMain idea here is potentially overlapping plots to see where differences arise. Code adapted from Claus Wilke’s source code. 4\n\n\npass_map_df %>% \n  filter(str_detect(name, \"Derek Carr|Mahomes\")) %>% \n  mutate(name = factor(name)) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_density(aes(x = y_coord, y = ..count.., fill = name, color = name),\n               alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5, color = \"red\", size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-10, 40)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 40, 5), name = \"Yardline\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, 10), name = \"scaled density\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\"), name = \"QB\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = scales::muted(c(\"#0072B2\", \"#D55E00\")), name = \"QB\") +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linetype = 0))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.line.x = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = c(.9, .87),\n    legend.justification = c(\"right\", \"top\"),\n    legend.box.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = \"white\"),\n    plot.margin = margin(3, 7, 3, 1.5)\n  )\n\n\nVisualizing many distributions at once - Plotting multiple or many distributions at once, and introduces the ggridges package\nMain idea here is overlapping many distributions at once, to see general trends or differences.\nggridges has a vignette on now to use it, but here’s a minimal example with the data at hand. Note that we are doing 1 dimensional density, so we could use this with nflfastR data as well!\n\n\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\npass_map_df %>% \n  filter(str_detect(name, \"Wilson|Mahomes|Prescott|Watson|Rodgers\")) %>% \n  mutate(name = word(name, 2)) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = y_coord, group = name, y = name)) +\n  stat_density_ridges(quantile_lines = TRUE, quantiles = 2, scale = 2) +\n  theme_ridges() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 60, 10), name = \"Yardline\") +\n  labs(y = \"\")\n\n\nHandling overlapping points - Dealing with overplotting with small data or big data\nWe create some bins and then plot the data for Mahomes. Here the data is relatively small, but still stacks.\n\n\nbin_data <- pass_map_df %>% \n  filter(str_detect(name, \"Mahomes\"), between(y_coord, -5, 20)) %>% \n  # create 5 yard bins on y axis\n  mutate(y_bins = y_coord - y_coord %% 5) \n\nbin_data %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_bins)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 20, 5))\n\n\nWe can add transparency with alpha along with geom_jitter() to add some random noise in the y-direction w/ height. Note that this is kind of a silly example since we have x and y coords, but you can imagine a situation where you only have binned data or like nflfastR you have large bins (left, middle right and short, long).\n\n\nbin_data %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_bins)) +\n  geom_jitter(height = 0.3, alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-5, 20, 5))\n\n\nClaus then goes on to cover details with geom_bin2d(), geom_hex(), and geom_contour(), still worth reading but stuff we’ve covered in the bulk of this post. Again, Claus’ book is amazing, and a great resource regardless of what software you are plotting in. He used R, but intentionally left out code and focused on concepts.\nFear the beard\nWe can display our points with a quick geom_point() call but this returns a lot of overplotting albeit in a happy beard shape!\n\n\npass_map_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\nWe can add 90% transparency with alpha = 0.1 or set alpha as uirea ratio, and change the color to red, but this still leaves us with difficulty parsing through the high vs medium pass locations. Although the 1/20 ratio gets us a bit farther. The ratio denominator can be though of as the “number of points that must overplotted to give a solid color.” 5\nPasses around the 5 yard mark appear to be as common as at the 10 and even 20 yard mark in some cases! We know this isn’t true from nflfastR data. Maybe we can try to get closer views of the actual distributions with ggMarginal from the ggExtra R package, which provides marginal histograms, box plots, or density plots.\n\n\nred_beard <- pass_map_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Alpha = 0.1 or 90% transparency\")\n\nred_beard_ratio <- pass_map_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 1/20, color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Alpha = 1/20, so 20 points must be stacked to give solid color\")\n\n\nred_beard + red_beard_ratio\n\n\nWe can add some marginal plots to help out a bit, but that still doesn’t solve the problem of honing in on specific areas of interest that well.\n\n\n# add density or histogram in the margins\nggMarginal(red_beard, type = \"density\", fill = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n# add density or histogram in the margins\nggMarginal(red_beard, type = \"histogram\", fill = \"red\")\n\n\n2D Density Alternatives\nSince we’re actually interested in the density/counts of observations at each x-y coordinate instead of plotting each individual point, we also have a few other tools in our toolbox! We can use geom_hex() or geom_bin2d(). Note that there are a few other methods such as geom_raster() which require you to provide your own “z” metric, and there are stat_? versions of each of these geoms for more custom calculations.\n\nIf you read the ggplot2 + overplotting ggplot2 book chapter, you can find more reproducible longer form examples and strategies with geom_hex() and geom_bin2d().\n\n\nhex_plot <- pass_map_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_hex(\n    binwidth = c(1, 1)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"red\", high = \"yellow\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(2, 7), color = \"grey\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 60, 5))\n\nhex_plot\n\n\nbin2d <- pass_map_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_bin2d(\n    binwidth = c(1, 1)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"red\", high = \"yellow\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = c(2, 7), color = \"grey\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 60, 5))\n\nbin2d\n\n\nWe can now see that while there ARE passes all over the field, the majority are around the 2-7 yard mark with small but relatively dense pockets elsewhere. Passes are most frequently thrown at 4, 5 or 6 yards and ~68% of passes are thrown 10 yards or shorter.\n\n\n# histogram of just Y coord\npass_map_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = y_coord)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = c(5)) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 60, 5))\n\n\n# calc some percentages\npass_by_y <- pass_map_df %>%\n  mutate(y_rnd = round(y_coord, digits = 0)) %>%\n  count(y_rnd) %>%\n  mutate(\n    total = sum(n),\n    pct_total = n / total,\n    roll_total = cumsum(pct_total)\n  )\n\n# ~35.6% of passes between 2-7 yards\npass_by_y %>%\n  filter(between(y_rnd, 2, 7)) %>%\n  summarize(pct = sum(pct_total))\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 1\n    pct\n  <dbl>\n1 0.351\n\n# passes are most commonly thrown at 4-6 yards\n# 68% of passes are thrown 10 yards or shorter\npass_by_y %>%\n  arrange(desc(pct_total))\n\n# A tibble: 68 x 5\n   y_rnd     n total pct_total roll_total\n   <dbl> <int> <int>     <dbl>      <dbl>\n 1     4  3705 49758    0.0745      0.408\n 2     5  3420 49758    0.0687      0.477\n 3     6  3248 49758    0.0653      0.542\n 4     2  2774 49758    0.0557      0.282\n 5     3  2550 49758    0.0512      0.333\n 6     1  1894 49758    0.0381      0.226\n 7     0  1775 49758    0.0357      0.188\n 8     7  1771 49758    0.0356      0.578\n 9     8  1736 49758    0.0349      0.612\n10    10  1642 49758    0.0330      0.672\n# … with 58 more rows\n\nDon’t bury the lede?\nAnother major advantage of geom_hex or geom_bin2d() is they’re remarkably faster for big data than plotting geom_point() along with reducing the likelihood of overplotting! For a toy example of about 1.7 million points, geom_hex() executes in about 2 sec vs 20 sec with geom_point(), and then subsequent 30-60 sec to “draw” the output in the viewer of R/RStudio.\n\nUsing these techniques are useful, as they are both computationally helpful (aka faster), and can help you better understand plots of “bigger” data.\n2D Density of “smaller” data\nSo we’ve covered hex and rectangular 2d bins. To me, these are not as attractive for “small data” like we may see for individual QB plots. Let’s take Patrick Mahomes for example, he only has ~1,000 passes in this dataset. We can plot with a geom_hex() for each 1x1 yard chunk like we did before, but I honestly have trouble determining trends of where he likes to throw with that graphic.\n\n\npass_map_df %>%\n  filter(str_detect(name, c(\"Mahomes\"))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_hex(binwidth = c(1, 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 60, 5))\n\n\nWe could always use larger bins, but if we’re just trying to see large trends we have another strategy in geom_density_2d().\n\nPerform a 2D kernel density estimation using MASS::kde2d() and display the results with contours. This can be useful for dealing with overplotting. This is a 2D version of geom_density(). geom_density_2d() draws contour lines, and geom_density_2d_filled() draws filled contour bands.\n\nThis essentially fits a polygon around the most frequent points by x/y coordinates, and then colors them according to density. In this case, x/y is basically the position on the field and “z” is the density of how many plots were thrown to that area.\n\n\npass_map_df %>%\n  filter(str_detect(name, c(\"Mahomes\"))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_density_2d_filled() +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 60, 5))\n\n\nNow if we want to get even more clever, we can use this compare passing heatmaps of specific QBs. We can normalize across the facets, and drop the least frequent passes with specific breaks. I’ve binned into 10 specific breakpoints, and by setting breaks between 0.1 and 1.0, we also drop the very least frequent passes which otherwise show up as a light fill of the entire remaining plot. Additionally, by adding a horizontal reference line we can pretty clearly see that Carr’s most common passes are behind the 5 yard line, while Mahomes has passed beyond the 5 yard line much more frequently.\n\n\npass_map_df %>%\n  filter(str_detect(name, c(\"Mahomes|Derek Carr\"))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_coord, y = y_coord)) +\n  geom_density_2d_filled(\n    aes(fill = ..level..),\n    contour_var = \"ndensity\", # normalize to each QBs total passes\n    breaks = seq(0.1, 1.0, length.out = 10) # drop the lowest passes\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-10, 60, 5)) +\n  facet_wrap(~name) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 5)\n\n\nThis is all well and good, but it’s not the prettiest piece of dataviz.\nThanks again to Ethan Douglas and his post on OpenSourceFootball.com 6, we have a good framework about how to approach building a NFL field as a graph.\nBuild the field\n\n\nnot_div_5 <- function(x) {\n  # select only elements of the vector not divisible by 5\n  x[x %% 5 != 0]\n}\n\ncenter_df <- tibble(\n  x_coord = c(rep(-3.1, 60), rep(3.1, 60)),\n  y_coord = seq(-14, 59, 1) %>% rep(2) %>% not_div_5(),\n  text = \"--\"\n)\n\n# line labels\nannotate_df <- tibble(\n  x_coord = c(12.88, -12.88) %>% rep(each = 5),\n  y_coord = seq(10, 50, 10) %>% rep(2),\n  text = seq(10, 50, 10) %>% rep(2) %>% str_replace(\"(.)(.)\", \"\\\\1 \\\\2\"),\n  rotation = c(90, 270) %>% rep(each = 5)\n)\n\n# yardlines\nyardline_df <- tibble(\n  y = seq(-15, 60, 5),\n  yend = seq(-15, 60, 5),\n  x = rep(-56 / 2, 16),\n  xend = rep(56 / 2, 16)\n)\n\n# sidelines\nsideline_df <- tibble(\n  y = c(-15.15, -15.15),\n  yend = c(60.15, 60.15),\n  x = c(-56 / 2, 56 / 2),\n  xend = c(-56 / 2, 56 / 2)\n)\n\nAfter building some datasets, we can now plot just the field without any other data.

I’ve gotten lots of requests for creating a distill blog from scratch, so I’ve finally gotten around to building that!\nPlease note that the docs for distill are already excellent, check them out at: Distill: Creating a Blog. This guide is aimed more at the end-to-end process of creating your first blog.\nThe first blog is typically the hardest and I’ve lived through the uncertainty of not really understanding how all the pieces work together. I appreciate the simplicity of distill for this very reason - there’s less stuff to change. At its core distill is just writing articles for a website/blog!\nI also have owed this post to many people, namely Maëlle Salmon and JD Long as seen on my Twitter.\nWhy consider distill?\nPros\nNo Hugo dependency, no theme dependency, it’s a very stable format with the ability to customize just enough with a bit of effort. Think a self-hosted Medium.com in appearance. Very minimal, lightly themed, focused on writing and code! Again, I think that for someone getting started with creating websites or blogs it’s a very good starting point.\nWith distill you render/knit your articles locally, so you can quickly check your work without having to deploy to a git branch or to production. I do think that eventually it is a good idea to have git branches for previews or collaboration, but that’s a lot to ask for an initial first stab at a blog/site.\ndistill also natively supports citations, footnotes and asides, a rich auto-generated table of contents, support for HTMLwidgets and/or custom javascript, and a reader friendly typography that is mobile friendly/auto-adapts to mobile.\nAnother nicety is the ability to import a post with import_post(). This means you can take an existing blogpost from another website and import it into your new blog. This “does not require the original R Markdown document used to author the post—you only need access to the published HTML of a post to import it.”\nLastly, I am always amazed at the power of both blogdown and the more recent hugodown, but you are still relying on a changing version of Hugo and your theme over time. For a personal blog I personally prefer distill because I can get busy, neglect my blog for a year, come back to write a new post, and it still just works.\nCons\nHowever, blogdown and hugodown allow dramatically more customization. distill is truly an opinionated framework, and most of the easy customization you can do is fonts, colors, and the navbar. If you expect to create gorgeous custom-layout sites like education.rstudio.com or something like Desirée de Leon’s blog you’re likely going to be disappointed!\nAgain, for my blog I really just wanted a simple but in my opinion elegant minimalist theme, so I was fine with the tradeoff, as I would have built something similar with blogdown anyway!\nblogdown also supports other static site generators like Jekyll in place of Hugo, and a rich set of pre-built themes across the various generators. The structure of the site is extensible as well, so you can generate a site that truly looks like your own creation.\nLastly, note that you DO lose some niceties like hugo shortcodes for embedding, and again there is ONLY ONE THEME. Most appearance customization is done at the level of custom CSS.\nIf you’re still with me, here’s how to make it!\nSteps to create\nStep 1: Install distill\ninstall.packages(\"distill”)\nStep 2: New project from distill blog\nWhat this is really doing is running the following command, and generates the output below.\n\n\n> distill::create_blog(dir = \"demo-distill\", title = \"Demo Distill\")\nCreating website directory demo-distill\nCreating demo-distill/_site.yml\nCreating demo-distill/index.Rmd\nCreating demo-distill/about.Rmd\nCreating demo-distill/_posts/welcome/welcome.Rmd\n\nThis will create a home-directory titled whatever you passed for the dir argument above, so in our case “demo-distill”. This will contain the _site.yml, the about.rmd file, the index.rmd file, and two folders: _posts and _site. You should definitely change the dir and title arguments to whatever you want your site to be named, although you can edit this later with a bit of work.\nWhile you’re welcome to explore _site I consider it something you SHOULD NOT edit by hand and it will commonly get overridden by rebuilding posts or the whole site. _site is essentially where the built site lives as final HTML and other supporting files. The _posts folder on the other hand contains all the raw RMDs you will use to create posts.\nStep 3: Preview\nAt this point the website is technically built! You can “preview” the site by going to:_site -> index.html\nThe index.html is essentially the home page for your blog. You can navigate from there in either the RStudio viewer or send it to a web browser just like a normal webpage.\nNote: you can also use the Build Website button in RStudio to pull up the whole website. This will re-knit and build the entire site from scratch.\nPreview of the siteStep 4: _site.yml\nThe _site.yml is where you control the overall details about your blog such as the name, title, description, and the navbar. You can add new “tabs” by changing the _site.yml file, where the default has a navbar with the site name on the left and a “Home” and “About” Tab on the right.\n\n\nname: \"demo-distill\"\ntitle: \"Demo Distill\"\ndescription: |\n  Demo Distill\noutput_dir: \"_site\"\nnavbar:\n  right:\n    - text: \"Home\"\n      href: index.html\n    - text: \"About\"\n      href: about.html\noutput: distill::distill_article\n\nStep 5: Example blog post\nNavigate to _posts -> welcome -> welcome.rmd. This is the default “hello world” example that comes with you distill. Note you can delete that folder completely to drop it from the site, but let’s use it as a practice ground first.\nThis is still just a RMarkdown file, but it has a specific YAML header, that contains a title, a description, author, date, and outputs to distill::distill_article().\nTry adding some more text, code, or other content to this blog post and then knit it! It will generate and show the final output in the RStudio viewer.\n\n\n---\ntitle: \"Welcome to Demo Distill\"\ndescription: |\n  Welcome to our new blog, Demo Distill. We hope you enjoy \n  reading what we have to say!\nauthor:\n  - name: Nora Jones \n    url: https://example.com/norajones\n    affiliation: Spacely Sprockets\n    affiliation_url: https://example.com/spacelysprokets\ndate: 07-27-2020\noutput:\n  distill::distill_article:\n    self_contained: false\n---\n\nStep 6: New post\nTo create a new post, you can run the following command:distill::create_post(\"title of post\")\nFull arguments seen below! I’ll call out two specific things.\ndraft argument: this prevents the post from being included in the site build until you turn it to FALSE. This is useful if you’re working on a blogpost over time, or want to come back to finish it later.\ndate_prefix: this adds a date like 2020-08-01-blog-post to the front of whatever your blog-post name is. This is useful as it also creates a folder structure that sorts properly, and prevents name clashes.\nWhenever you run the create_post() command it will generate a new folder and the basic RMarkdown doc to get started with the arguments you passed.\n\ncreate_post(\n  title, # mandatory\n  author = \"auto\",\n  slug = \"auto\", # generates a website slug (URL)\n  date_prefix = TRUE, # adds date for sorting\n  draft = FALSE, \n  edit = interactive()\n)\n\nNote that a nice overview of the Blog Post Workflow is covered at the distill site. This includes collaborating via Git Branches (or using them as previews). I push to my main branch all the time since I’m working solo.\nStep 7: Add to Git\nWe’re following instructions at: Chapter 17 Existing project, GitHub last | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR. If you’re a Git expert, feel free to use whatever method you like. From my experience setting up a few blogs this is the least painful if you’re NOT a Git expert.\n\nYou could also do the create GitHub and then connect it to RStudio route Chapter 17 Existing project, GitHub last | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR.\nNOTE: if you don’t have a GitHub PAT, get one now by following these instructions B GitHub Personal Access Tokens | Happy Git and GitHub for the useR.\nThis will first use Git locally, and then create a new GitHub repo based off your existing local files.\nRun the usethis::use_git() command, which will kick off some questions:\nDon’t commit just yet (Select 3: Not Now)\nRestart RStudio (Select 2: Yes)\nYou will know it all worked when you have the git logo at the top of RStudio\nGit logoClick on the Git logo and commit everything, notice we can’t push since we haven’t configured GitHub yet\nInitial commitusethis::use_github() — this works if you have already configured a GitHub Personal Access Token\nNext select https if you don’t have SSH keys\nSay 1: yup to the title and description\n\nExample of what your console commands are and their output seen below!\n\n\n> usethis::use_github()\n✓ Setting active project to '/Users/thomasmock/demo-distill-blog'\n✓ Checking that current branch is 'master'\nWhich git protocol to use? (enter 0 to exit) \n\n1: ssh   <-- presumes that you have set up ssh keys\n2: https <-- choose this if you don't have ssh keys (or don't know if you do)\n\nSelection: 2\n● Tip: To suppress this menu in future, put\n  `options(usethis.protocol = \"https\")`\n  in your script or in a user- or project-level startup file, '.Rprofile'.\n  Call `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to open it for editing.\n● Check title and description\n  Name:        demo-distill-blog\n  Description: \nAre title and description ok?\n\n1: Yup\n2: No way\n3: Negative\n\nSelection: 1\n✓ Creating GitHub repository\n✓ Setting remote 'origin' to 'https://github.com/jthomasmock/demo-distill-blog.git'\n✓ Pushing 'master' branch to GitHub and setting remote tracking branch\n✓ Opening URL 'https://github.com/jthomasmock/demo-distill-blog'\n\nOnce this is all run, it should open up a new webpage with your fancy new GitHub repo! Mine opened at: GitHub - jthomasmock/demo-distill-blog.\nStep 8: Netlify\nNow that we have our files on Github, we’re ready to deploy via Netlify!\nYou’ll need to Create an account at netlify if you don’t have one already.\nOnce you’re logged in:\nFirst click on import from Git\nNew site from GitClick on Configure netlify on GitHub, and follow their instructions to allow access, and then add the selected repository you want to send over (demo-distill-blog for me)\nClick Save!\n\nAdd specific repoClick on demo-distill-blog or whatever your blog’s name is!\nIMPORTANT\nMake sure to set the Publish Directory to _site (so Netlify can find the knitted HTML content)\nAnd then click deploy!\nMake sure to set publish directory to _siteYou’ll get a fun temporary name (mine was https://confident-meitner-e6e7dc.netlify.app/). You can change this with the Domain Settings to some-name.netlify.app or even purchase a custom domain like I did for example themockup.blog or what Sharla Gelfand did with sharla.party.\nNow your website should be up and running! If you don’t see a site (it 404s), then I would check to make sure you set the Publish Director to _site, otherwise it won’t know where to find the actual HTML content.\nStep 9: Blog post workflows\n\nWorkflow difference: Furthermore, website pages and root pages of blogs are re-rendered when the site is rebuilt but blog articles are not. Each blog article has to be rendered on its own, with intent. Why? Given that R package upgrades have a tendency to break older code, continuously re-rendering old posts is nearly impossible to do without errors, especially over longer periods of time.\n\nThis means you can “Build Site” frequently locally to check out how things work. This is personally the workflow I prefer vs having to commit the output to GitHub or a GitHub branch just to see the preview. You can also knit individual blog posts and they will adapt to your theme, so you can again test local changes whenever you’d like!\nTo get things into “production” once you have set up Netlify, you’ll just need to knit the new blog post, then commit and push to GitHub.\nYou can use command line git or the git integration in RStudio.\nExample of git in RStudioBasic idea is click commit and then push.\nExample of a commitNext Steps\nIf this guide didn’t provide enough detail, make sure to check out the Blog Post Workflow that goes into specific examples, like importing posts from elsewhere, changing URLs, updating old posts, etc.\nNow that you have a website running you can either leave it exactly as it is formatted, and just add new posts or you can do a little bit of customization to the “About Me”, Home page, etc.\nA lot of options are already covered at Distill for R Markdown: Creating a Blog\nA few notes:\nIf you want Twitter cards to show up with your images, you need to add a preview: some_img_name.png argument to the YAML header for each post.\nIf you define a custom domain you’ll need to change the base_url at the _site.yml file\nCustomize Appearance\nProbably of most interest to folks is customizing the appearance of the blog.\nIn general the strategy you should use is to inspect parts of the website for the class names and then you can apply CSS to change it\nA nice overview of the “Inspect” tool is covered here\nHTML/CSS classes and selectors are covered in the Mozilla docs here\nTo use a custom CSS file, you’ll need to change the output in _site.yml to include the below:\n\n\noutput: \n  distill::distill_article:\n    css: styles.css\n\nI keep my styles.css file at the same level as my _site.yml file.\nExample changes\nYou’ll need to store all of these in your styles.css file, and note that some of them depend on other changes - specifically to use custom fonts you ALSO have to import the custom fonts!\nBold silver title, pink background\n\n\n.distill-site-nav {\n  color: #C0C0C0; \n  background-color: #FF1493;\n  font-size: 20px;\n  font-weight: 900;\n}\n\nWant entire webpage to be “pink”?\n\nbody {\n  background-color: #FF1493;\n}\nChange hover color in nav bar\n\n.distill-site-nav a:hover {\n  color: #383838;\n}\nChange header font or color\n\n/* Change appearance of headers */\nh1, h2, h3, h4, h5 {\n  font-family: 'Fira Mono', sans-serif;\n  color: color: #383838;\n}\nImport custom fonts from Google\n\n/* Import fonts from Google's API */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lato');\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fira+Mono');\nUse those fonts throughout\n\n/* Use specific font in the body of the text */\nhtml, body, p {\n  \n  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;\n  font-weight: 200;\n  line-height: 1.3; \n  font-size: 1.0em;\n  color: #333333;\n  font-style: normal;\n  \n}\nChange in-line code\n\n/* Change the appearance of in-line code chunks */\ncode {\n  font-family: 'Fira Mono', sans-serif;\n  color: #383838;\n  background: #F5F5F5;\n  font-weight: 400;\n  font-size: 0.9em;\n}\nChange code chunk colors\n\nd-code {\n  background: grey;\n}\n\n\n",

The plots below are his original ideas, just recreated in ggplot2.\nI originally recreated his plots in ggplot2 and published them as a gist and on Twitter in July 2019, stumbled upon it again recently, and thought why not capture it as a proper blog-post!\nAdditionally, when I originally made these remakes, ggplot2 required coord_flip() whereas the most recent version of ggplot2 allows you to natively create horizontal bar charts! I’ve thus changed a little bit of the code from the original gist to reflect the new options in ggplot2.\nAgain thank you to Andy Kirk for the prompt!

Her blogpost covers her guide on her well-informed approach for teaching R Markdown.\nShe has taught:\n- College students as a professor across a semester\n- In person professional learners at RStudio::conf in 1-2 day workshops\n- Digital Learners in Pharma/Finance/etc via shorter online workshops\nTo summarize her post:\nMake it. Make it again. - Show how knitting works throughout the process.\nMake it pretty - Engage your learners with visuals, tables, etc - motivation is key!\nMake it snappy - Get a shareable link the first 20 min (usually via Netlify Drop).\nMake it real - “Teach folks what they need to know to actually use the tool productively in real life.”\nMake it easy - “People will only keep using R Markdown if they see it making their life easier. So show them how. For example, the RStudio IDE has some very nice built-in features that make it much easier to be an R Markdown user.”\nAgain - GO READ her blogpost for additional links and guides she links to.\nMy blogpost below is meant to be a sister article to hers, framed with a similar approach we use in Customer Success but different in that we’re not doing as much long-form education. Alison’s approach is well-informed and very useful in the context of direct teaching activity, which is why I wanted to share it as well!\nHow I share knowledge around R Markdown\nI work on a different team than Alison at RStudio, specifically I’m a Customer Success Manager. This means that I work with existing RStudio Pro Product customers, most often people who have RStudio Connect. I work exclusively with High Tech/Software customers, meaning that they are typically already doing very sophisticated work with R in production, and I’m helping them further eliminate friction or empower their data science teams to do more with R.\nA core part of my job is knowledge sharing around how to use open-source software like R Markdown with or without our Pro Products. Thus most of my work is Strategic in nature, although I do often give shorter 30-60 min training sessions that are Tactical.\n\nA strategy is a set of guidelines used to achieve an overall objective, whereas tactics are the specific actions aimed at adhering to those guidelines. Source: Wikipedia\n\nThus my usual framing is covering topics that inform the learner of new strategies (ways of solving a problem) without necessary having to teach all the tactics (nuts and bolts of how it all works).\nThis post will focus on 4 core strategies of why R Markdown is SO useful and absolutely worth learning with links to external tactics/guides/write-ups of how to accomplish the various tasks.\nCat reading a military strategy bookR Markdown for Literate Programming\nGoal: Capture code, text/comments, and output in a single document\nThis is the most common use of R Markdown, and is often how it is taught in University coursework. R Markdown is a tool for Literate Programming, and in summary is:\n\nA programming paradigm introduced by Donald Knuth in which a computer program is given an explanation of its logic in a natural language, such as English, interspersed with snippets of macros and traditional source code, from which compilable source code can be generated.\n\nNot just for R\nR Markdown obviously has rich support for R-based code and data products, but did you know it also supports:\n- Native Python or calling Python from R via reticulate\n- SQL - Blog post by Irene Steves\n- CSS or JavaScript for all sorts of customization\n- As well as Bash, Rcpp, Stan, and other formats\n- All together there are 52(!) possible language engines coming from knitr\nMVP of Reproducibility\nWhether you talk about Minimum Viable Product or Most Valuable Player, it works! Since R Markdown is a form of Literate Programming, you can write all of your comments, notes, and execute your code within it.\nR Markdown HAS to run successfully to save/knit the output\nR Markdown is self-documenting (the code is embedded)\nThe code is diffable and easily human readable in version control\nSelf-contained workspace\nExploratory Data Analysis\nAn example here is for Dave Robinson’s #TidyTuesday screencasts + code\nDave uses R Markdown to explore a brand new dataset each week, capturing his comments and train of thought as he tests the data, performs basic analyses, and moves towards a modeling or deliverable data product\nMan plotting an upward curveR Markdown as a Data Product\nGoal: Generate output natively in R for consumption\nThis is typically the second most common use of R Markdown. Since R Markdown can knit to all sorts of different formats, it is a powerful tool for creating data products like:\nPresentations\nPowerpoint\nWeb-formats - xaringan (remark.js)\nLateX formats - Beamer\nDashboards with flexashboard\nLets you quickly build beautiful dashboards with either static or reactive components\nReports\nSupports HTML Documents, PDF, Word and many others\nEntire Websites\nblogdown for easily extensible custom websites or blogs\ndistill for scientific writing, native to the web (this website is built in distill)\nMost importantly these formats are created with code, so you get the benefit of reproducibility, automation, etc while still generating data products in the format your non-coder colleagues expect.\nChild operating mission controlR Markdown as a Control Document\nGoal: Scale data science tasks, automate the boring stuff, create robust pipelines\nLess widely known, but just as important is the idea of R Markdown as a meta-document that lets you bring in other code or automate processes.\nAs it’s much larger in scope than a single bullet point I’d recommend going to read Emily Riederer’s blog post on Rmarkdown Driven Development. It’s “an approach of using R Markdown within the larger scope of the analysis engineering concept” presented by Hilary Parker.\nA brief summary of her blogpost:\n\nI tend to think of each RMarkdown as having a “data product” (an analytical engine calibrated to answer some specific question) nestled within it. Surfacing this tool just requires a touch of forethought before beginning an analysis and a bit of clean-up afterwards.\nIn this post, I describe RMarkdown Driven Development: a progression of stages between a single ad-hoc RMarkdown script and more advanced and reusable data products like R projects and packages. This approach has numerous benefits.\n\nAutomation w/ parameters\nParameters are data passed to the R Markdown document to generate new outputs from the same code.\nAn example here is generating a report for all 50 US states.\nRather than writing 50 reports manually, you can pass a parameter of state to the R Markdown report and render 50x reports at once!\nThe input R Markdown is always the same, but you pass each state as a parameter programatically to generate a new report for EACH state with it’s data.\n\nParamaterized reports\nParameterized report cookbook\nParameterized Reports site\nChild Documents\nChild documents allow you to bring in OTHER RMarkdown code/documents into a parent, meaning you can use the parent document as a meta-document referencing code/outputs in other documents.\nThis can greatly help with the flow/size of a single document and you can essentially modularize portions of the document.\nIt’s worth noting that you should read Emily’s post above on building up a robust R Markdown workflow.\nChild Documents\nChild Documents - Yihui’s Blog\n\nRMarkdown for Emails w/ blastula\nWhile this is technically a data-product, because it is generating an email I’m putting it as a Control Document. The short of this is that blastula provides a framework to generate HMTL emails from R Markdown, which are then sent by an email server or RStudio Connect.\nThis Blastula Webinar covers a lot of the use cases, all with code and real-life applications\n\nR Markdown + RStudio Connect as an execution engine\nR Markdown is a first-class citizen on RStudio Connect, and you can interactively generate new reports based on parameters, or schedule R Markdown documents to re-execute documents on a schedule.\nCode for ETL - an example of an ETL process through an automated R Markdown report, this could query against a SQL database or a spark cluster to process ETL jobs, all on a schedule down to the minute or up to a year.\nScheduled reporting - maybe your boss needs a report built every Monday? You can do that too - pulling in new data and re-generating a report on a specific time-schedule all with no need for human intervention.\nEmailing w/ blastula - maybe your boss is too busy to consume a full report every day - send a conditional email directly to them if a specific number is hit or missed all with code in R! This email could is built with R Markdown, and could contain plots, tables, raw data, or attach ANY R Markdown-based document (so… basically anything).\nGif of a machine creating jelly rollsRMarkdown for Templating\nGoal: Don’t repeat yourself, generate input templates or output documents from code.\nUsing R Markdown for templating is normally thought of for knitr::render() + parameters, but there’s additional techniques to solve specific problems that don’t fit neatly into paramaterized reports as well.\nKnitting w/ knit::render()\nThis is the first step towards using a template, and lets you generate R Markdown outputs programatically with code. It can be coupled with parameters or with other arguments for outputs locations, etc.\nLooping outputs\nThis is really still focused at data products, but programmatically building up portions WITHIN a document.\nIn this example, I’m taking a single function and using purrr::walk() to generate new outputs from a template within the R Markdown report.\nNote that for the chunk that outputs the repeated portions, you have to set results=\"asis\" in the chunk option.\n\nMinimal example below with the palmerpenguins dataset. Full copy-pastable code at: https://git.io/JJBcC.\nNote that I’m writing one function and calling it n times, it would loop across all the data based on the different inputs.\n\n---\noutput: html_document\n---\n  \n  \n```{r penguin function, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(glue)\npenguins <- palmerpenguins::penguins\nmultiplot <- function(penguin_name){\n  cat(glue::glue(\"  \\n### {penguin_name}  \\n  \\n\"))\n  df_pen <- penguins %>% \n    filter(as.character(species) == penguin_name) %>% \n    na.omit()\n  \n  flipper_len <- df_pen %>% \n    summarize(mean = mean(flipper_length_mm)) %>% \n    pull(mean) %>% \n    round(digits = 1)\n  \n  bill_len <- df_pen %>% \n    summarize(mean = mean(bill_length_mm)) %>% \n    pull(mean) %>% \n    round(digits = 1)\n  \n  cat(\n    glue::glue(\"There are {nrow(df_pen)} observations of {penguin_name} penguins. The average flipper length is {flipper_len} and the average bill length is {bill_len}.  \\n\")\n  )\n  \n  plot_out <- df_pen %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    labs(x = \"Bill Length\", y = \"Flipper Length\", title = penguin_name)\n  \n  print(plot_out)\n  \n  cat(\"  \\n  \\n\")\n}\n```\n\n```{r loop output,fig.width=6,echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,results=\"asis\"}\npurrr::walk(unique(as.character(penguins$species)), multiplot)\n```\n\n<!-- https://git.io/JJBcC -->\nWhich generates the following document:\nLoop Output in RMDwhisker\nwhisker is a templating engine for R conforming to the Mustache specification.\nIt uses glue style syntax to add data to templates either in memory or to an output file, where my mental model is it is glue for documents rather than strings.\nYou can include templates from all sorts of inputs, like R files, R Markdown, markdown or plain text.\nThese templates can be local directories, or stored in the inst directory of an R package.\nLastly, these can also generate outputs in the same format, eg you can create templates/outputs for R, R Markdown or other plain-text formats!\nMinimal whisker example below:\nFirst, some input data:\n\ndata <- list(\n  name = \"Chris\", \n  value = 10000, \n  taxed_value = 10000 - (10000 * 0.4), \n  in_ca = TRUE\n)\n\nThen a template:\n\ntemplate <-\n'Hello {{name}}\nYou have just won ${{value}}!\n{{#in_ca}}\nWell, ${{taxed_value}}, after taxes.\n{{/in_ca}}'\nNow, fill the template!\n\ntext <- whisker.render(template, data)\ncat(text)\n\n# Output\nHello Chris\nYou have just won $10000!\nWell, $6000, after taxes.\nI use whisker natively to generate the readme files for each week’s #TidyTuesday submission. Separate blog-post to come for that!\nusethis::use_template()\nAlternatively to natively using whisker usethis::use_template() provides a more ready to use function, and uses whisker internally.\nuse_template() Used as the engine for a templating function in other packages.\n\nSharla Gelfand, the “Queen of Reproducible Reporting”, put together lots of material using the usethis::use_template() workflow in their work.\nSharla Gelfand’s use_template() blogpost\nIn short, they turned an annual report from a mess of copy-pasting and manual work into a fast, streamlined, reproducible, and easily repeatable workflow using R, R Markdown, and usethis::use_template().\nRecording of their presentation on the same topic\nSlides for that presentation.\n\nFin\nSo that’s an overview of my approach to sharing knowledge around R Markdown, and like Alison said:\n\nBut remember: there is no one way to learn R Markdown, and no one way to teach it either. I love seeing the creativity of the community when introducing the R Markdown family - so keep them coming!\n\n\n\n",

This is great, because it allows you to do many things:\nAdd client-side interactivity\neg Shiny-lite without a server!\n\nCombine interactivity between multiple HTML Widgets\nHave a interactive plot interact with an interactive table\n\nPass client-side interactions back to a Shiny runtime\nWe’ll continue on our example use-cases of interactive tables w/ reactable, but now add in a bit of crosstalk to show how this can be useful.\nMy previous posts on:\n- reactable - How to guide for interactive tables\n- gt - How to guide for static tables\n1st Round WRs\nLike most examples, we’ll need additional data for this example. ESPN was kind enough to give us a hot-take to start off with:\nSource: https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/1255168243863609344 Pretty striking huh? Of these tops QBs, Rodgers has almost no 1st round receivers on his team (or TE/RB). But what about the rest of the story? WHO does he throw TDs to?\nLet’s take a look at the data, courtesy of pro-football-reference.com. The following 3 data sources got me these results (and the raw RDS file output can be found here & here).\nPFR Draft Query\nThis allows you to specify positions, years, etc\n\nPFR Pass TD table\nThis is ALL the top players and the number of TDs they’s thrown, with sub-links to each of the QB’s homepage, which has an additional list of WHO caught each of these passes\n\nPFR Draft by Year\nThis is the draft results by year, I joined this against the passing list for each of these QBs to align draft data.\n\n\nNote that I did a rough join by name, I’m not THAT concerned with confirming the data, but I did a spot check down to receivers with 10 or more TDs\nPrep the data\nLet’s read in our data - however note that this is long-format, so it’s not ideal for our summary table. We’ll tidyr::pivot_wider() in the next step and use some new dplyr features!\nHowever we can see that we have:\n- a passer\n- a draft round variable (round)\n- total touchdowns thrown (n)\n- total touchdowns thrown (total)\n- the ratio of touchdowns thrown per round relative to the total touchdowns normalized to each passer (ratio).\n\n\nlibrary(htmltools)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(reactable)\n\n# read in our summary data\nsummary_qbs <- readr::read_rds(\"summary_qbs.rds\")\n\nglimpse(summary_qbs)\n\nRows: 96\nColumns: 5\n$ passer <chr> \"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Aaron Rodgers\", \"Aaron Rodgers\", \"…\n$ rnd    <fct> Rnd 1, Rnd 2, Rnd 3, Rnd 4, Rnd 5, Rnd 6, Rnd 7, Und…\n$ n      <int> 1, 191, 82, 5, 23, 6, 24, 32, 69, 31, 101, 35, 17, 7…\n$ total  <int> 364, 364, 364, 364, 364, 364, 364, 364, 365, 365, 36…\n$ ratio  <dbl> 0.002747253, 0.524725275, 0.225274725, 0.013736264, …\n\nWe’ll use tidyr::unnest_wider() to widen this data where each passer/QB get their own row and the round of their receivers get their own column.

pro-football-reference.com\n\n\n\nThis table shows us a lot - Rodgers actually has thrown the most passes to 2nd Round receivers of any of these QBs, and the most passes to 1st, 2nd or 3rd Round receivers, along with the fewest passes to undrafted receivers! Not quite, the same storyline. An additional consideration - where in the overall draft were the players catching passes taken?\n\nSpoiler - most of Rodger’s receivers were actually top 4-5 WRs in their respective draft classes.\nLet’s talk about crosstalk\nFor a bit of a deeper dive, we can go up one level and rather than focusing on just the QBs, we can look at the QBs and stats on who has caught their passes. We’ll also use crosstalk to provide some rich interactive filtering purely on the client side, this means all done in browser as opposed to needing a Shiny runtime/server backend.\nOur first step is to load the crosstalk library and define our SharedData - this is how crosstalk knows how to relate the interaction together - the data is added to a new object that is shared across various resources. For simple examples, once this is defined you can just use the newly defined wr_data just as you would normal dataframes.\nLet’s try it out!\n\n\nlibrary(crosstalk)\n\njoined_tds <- read_rds(\"joined_tds.rds\") %>% \n  # drop some QBs to keep it at 8 for example purposes\n  filter(!passer %in% c(\"Matthew Stafford\", \"Carson Palmer\", \"Eli Manning\", \n                        \"Matt Ryan\"))\n\nwr_data <- SharedData$new(joined_tds)\n\nFor this first table, we’ll just stay simple, with the major addition being that we’re adding a longer description to the pos_rank column which is a tricky definition. You can now hover over the column label to get a tooltip. I’ve also done something relatively easy to do, but that adds some complexity. I’ve grouped each QB so that their WRs display as sub-tables within the parent row. You can “open” the quarterback rows by clicking on the arrow next to their name.\nThe other reactable portion I’ve done is providing specific summary statistics at the level of the QB group. We accomplish this with groupBy inside reactable, and you then define what type of aggregation you want inside the colDef. I have unique teams for team, count of total receivers for receiver, sum of total TDs for TDs caught, unique position draft rank for position draft, and frequency for draft round. Note that you can still interact with this table normally, and that we haven’t used any special crosstalk features yet. Also: side note - I’ve replaced undrafted players with a pos_rank of 44. This is the max of pos_rank for drafted players + 1. Deal with it! (#sorry).\n\nI’m much more interested in spending more time on how-to-guides than adding in 150 undrafted free agent ranks. 🤷\n\n\nh3(\"Touchdown recipients grouped by quarterback\")\nTouchdown

add ons\nSo that table is interactive, but it’s all sorting. What about all the special crosstalk features?\nWe can align some filters and the table together with bootstrap columns (similar to setting up shiny structure). These come along with loading crosstalk. Note that this is because I’m working in a traditional RMarkdown to build this distill website, and if I were using something like flexdashboard, it has alternate and more robust methods of aligning various plots, tables, control boxes, etc.\nAlso! Note that because I’m using the shared data across multiple areas, if I filter at any stage it will effect ALL the shared data tables. So if you play with the example below, make sure to reset all the settings before continuing on.\n\n\n\n# bootstrap columns\nh3(\"Interactive QB Table with Filtering\")\nInteractive QB Table with

it! No setting up shiny, no server, you get all this filtering for free! Now there’s still a spectrum where shiny adds a LOT of value - namely, I want to do more custom work and need to execute additional R code!\nAdditional crosstalk features\nNow while the table-level filtering is nice, you can also communicate between various crosstalk enabled widgets, including plotly graphs, reactable, DT, and leaflet.\nThis is a rather minimal example as far as plotly, but you can see some of the interaction across the 3 levels (filters, plotly, reactable). The main additions I have for plotly are adding specific hover text.\nAs a fun exploration - try filtering Pos Rank to 1-5 - Rodgers has 7 receivers in this category.\n\n\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# add a

@thomas_mock | Data: Pro-football-reference.com\n\n\n\nSo overall - we’re able to do some exploration of the data at specific filters very easily and without having to setup or do a lot of extra work.\nFollowup\nThis can be further extended to shiny - where some of the interaction can happen at the level of the client (ie JavaScript) and other portions can be pushed down to R (shiny) or even a database backend (ie SQL).\nHopefully this gives you an additional picture as to WHY interactive tables and/or client-side interactivity can help expand your ability to share details in R.\nThat’s out of scope for today, but reading material at:\n- Free plotly R book\n- crosstalk + Shiny website\n\n\n",

I’ve got the final code below, which is just a few lines, and a major helper package for examining nested lists such as JSON. Most of this post is about some approaches to exploring JSON outputs and deeply nested lists. Additionally the tidyverse team even has an article on various approaches to “rectangling” nested data/JSON here.\nWe’re using another NFL example this week, namely we are collecting data from ESPN’s Quarterback Rating (QBR) API endpoint. The output website that this API feeds is available here and the API endpoint itself is available here.\nRStudio Viewer\n\n\nThe RStudio viewer is also super useful for navigating, once you have the data in R\n\n— Hadley Wickham (@hadleywickham) May 25, 2020\n\nFunction&&Function.prototype&&Function.prototype.bind&&(/(MSIE

The highlighted name is the code used to access that object.\nThe opened athletes object opened through the RStudio Viewerlistviewer\nSecondly, the listviewer package is also fantastic! It lets you explore JSON interactively in a similar way to the RStudio Viewer. We can use this to interactively explore the data before we start coding away.\nBecause we’re looking at the 2019 season, I know that Lamar Jackson is the top QB in the dataset, and we can guess at some of the other columns by going to the actual webpage this API is building. From that we can assume there are columns for player name, team name, QBR, PAA, PLAYS, etc.\nExample of the websiteI’ll let you do this interactively because that’s how’d you use in RStudio, and try searching for:\n- Lamar Jackson – important for finding the QB names\n- 81.8 – this one is important as a data point\nIn the interactive jsonedit() viewer below:\n\n\n# interactive list or JSON viewer\n# note that you can change the view to raw JSON or the more \n# interactive `View` option\nlistviewer::jsonedit(raw_json, height = \"800px\", mode = \"view\")\n\n{\"x\":{\"data\":{\"pagination\":{\"count\":30,\"limit\":50,\"page\":1,\"pages\":1,\"first\":\"http://site.api.espn.com:80/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?isqualified=true&lang=en&qbrtype=seasons&region=us&season=2019&seasontype=2&sort=schedAdjQBR%3Adesc&limit=50\",\"last\":\"http://site.api.espn.com:80/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?isqualified=true&lang=en&qbrtype=seasons&region=us&season=2019&seasontype=2&sort=schedAdjQBR%3Adesc&limit=50&page=1\"},\"athletes\":{\"athlete\":{\"id\":[\"3916387\",\"3139477\",\"2580\",\"2577417\",\"14881\",\"12483\",\"3122840\",\"8664\",\"14876\",\"16757\",\"2573079\",\"16760\",\"14880\",\"11237\",\"3917315\",\"2969939\",\"2330\",\"3917792\",\"3052587\",\"8439\",\"2578570\",\"3046779\",\"5529\",\"3918298\",\"3912547\",\"4038524\",\"14012\",\"3039707\",\"3115293\",\"3116407\"],\"uid\":[\"s:20~l:28~a:3916387\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3139477\",\"s:20~l:28~a:2580\",\"s:20~l:28~a:2577417\",\"s:20~l:28~a:14881\",\"s:20~l:28~a:12483\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3122840\",\"s:20~l:28~a:8664\",\"s:20~l:28~a:14876\",\"s:20~l:28~a:16757\",\"s:20~l:28~a:2573079\",\"s:20~l:28~a:16760\",\"s:20~l:28~a:14880\",\"s:20~l:28~a:11237\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3917315\",\"s:20~l:28~a:2969939\",\"s:20~l:28~a:2330\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3917792\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3052587\",\"s:20~l:28~a:8439\",\"s:20~l:28~a:2578570\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3046779\",\"s:20~l:28~a:5529\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3918298\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3912547\",\"s:20~l:28~a:4038524\",\"s:20~l:28~a:14012\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3039707\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3115293\",\"s:20~l:28~a:3116407\"],\"guid\":[\"7d76fbb11c5ed9f4954fcad43f720ae2\",\"37d87523280a9d4a0adb22cfc6d3619c\",\"a3d4f4473aef111aee5c4909a8e70a7c\",\"5f09781b6b0b7325049ba91e60d794e6\",\"f0610946ceb69a993bcccf110b2078b5\",\"20c41c33a33f6dc27e1f0771e39ce49a\",\"b6ec8e9e3d85a1de9d0a5a51621a9c20\",\"5dab6f81c90caeb6e2c3a4ab46ec447b\",\"2d6af5dcb3d3e2d4cf7227d4a8eb93cd\",\"50d25930fd5f311dd93213e5ab467ff7\",\"ed28fa2c63a18258b6b0618e79d3e363\",\"1d58c0548e0e1f6e726702ec9679f43f\",\"53bec012c2edbc7ca8d5438611f9faa1\",\"c79f38c2a37e5dfcdd3da91f4811b2cd\",\"9bef707dd33f266b302081900d735915\",\"57af2581cec9d5a32afe7a719925f78b\",\"be3c0e305a1e8174091da41bf4e2d51e\",\"5ad1bcc257bcbb72bcd00cdd0d945444\",\"5bb4376ad089e3e4e49a44f1d709a012\",\"5fbab03e281655abae1083b132803d9e\",\"efcb42e50bef62d1b58bdbc17fde2479\",\"987f4f39ed6f591557ebec7dc356171c\",\"a7d4c3f14297af471b05c8fa86cc815e\",\"853f876854bd6a4fcb1063d6df1e7742\",\"938f19a1ef9b618c2365d55291e0fcc6\",\"a64e025b8608fd26e1f8df83133d7a59\",\"10080fc5c043a458e54d428c18555089\",\"bcf9133c2510f4530f0bc68c1a5d0af7\",\"5ce7c1f8b2be23104d44ad43e67c8175\",\"779f3cff73ebdcb6132748a95fa9d491\"],\"type\":[\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\",\"football\"],\"firstName\":[\"Lamar\",\"Patrick\",\"Drew\",\"Dak\",\"Russell\",\"Matthew\",\"Deshaun\",\"Ryan\",\"Ryan\",\"Derek\",\"Carson\",\"Jimmy\",\"Kirk\",\"Matt\",\"Kyler\",\"Jameis\",\"Tom\",\"Daniel\",\"Baker\",\"Aaron\",\"Jacoby\",\"Jared\",\"Philip\",\"Josh\",\"Sam\",\"Gardner\",\"Andy\",\"Mitchell\",\"Kyle\",\"Mason\"],\"lastName\":[\"Jackson\",\"Mahomes\",\"Brees\",\"Prescott\",\"Wilson\",\"Stafford\",\"Watson\",\"Fitzpatrick\",\"Tannehill\",\"Carr\",\"Wentz\",\"Garoppolo\",\"Cousins\",\"Ryan\",\"Murray\",\"Winston\",\"Brady\",\"Jones\",\"Mayfield\",\"Rodgers\",\"Brissett\",\"Goff\",\"Rivers\",\"Allen\",\"Darnold\",\"Minshew II\",\"Dalton\",\"Trubisky\",\"Allen\",\"Rudolph\"],\"displayName\":[\"Lamar Jackson\",\"Patrick Mahomes\",\"Drew Brees\",\"Dak Prescott\",\"Russell Wilson\",\"Matthew Stafford\",\"Deshaun Watson\",\"Ryan Fitzpatrick\",\"Ryan Tannehill\",\"Derek Carr\",\"Carson Wentz\",\"Jimmy Garoppolo\",\"Kirk Cousins\",\"Matt Ryan\",\"Kyler Murray\",\"Jameis Winston\",\"Tom Brady\",\"Daniel Jones\",\"Baker Mayfield\",\"Aaron Rodgers\",\"Jacoby Brissett\",\"Jared Goff\",\"Philip Rivers\",\"Josh Allen\",\"Sam Darnold\",\"Gardner Minshew II\",\"Andy Dalton\",\"Mitchell Trubisky\",\"Kyle Allen\",\"Mason Rudolph\"],\"shortName\":[\"L.

The only awkward part is like JavaScript it indexes from 0… so as usual note that index == 0 is index == 1 in R. The listviewer author does have a little helper function in this regard.\nFor example:\nIf you search for 81.8 and click on the 81.8 cell, you’ll get the following location:\nobject > athletes > categories > 0 > totals > 0 > 0\nwhich is equivalent to the following in R:\nraw_json[[\"athletes\"]][[\"categories\"]][[1]][[\"totals\"]][[1]][[1]]\nThe listviewer strategy can allow you to explore interactively, while the code below is more of moving through the JSON object in R.\nLet’s get into the code itself to extract and work with the JSON data.\nThe code\nThis utilizes purrr to get at the various components, but I’ll also show how to do this with mostly base R.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n# link to the API output as a JSON file\nurl_json <- \"https://site.web.api.espn.com/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?region=us&lang=en&qbrType=seasons&seasontype=2&isqualified=true&sort=schedAdjQBR%3Adesc&season=2019\"\n\n# get the raw json into R\nraw_json <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url_json)\n\n# get names of the QBR categories\ncategory_names <- pluck(raw_json, \"categories\", \"labels\", 1)\n\n# Get the QBR stats by each player (row_n = player)\nget_qbr_data <- function(row_n) {\n  purrr::pluck(raw_json, \"athletes\", \"categories\", row_n, \"totals\", 1) %>% \n    as.double() %>% \n    set_names(nm = category_names)\n}\n\n# create the dataframe and tidy it up\nex_output <- pluck(raw_json, \"athletes\", \"athlete\") %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  select(displayName, teamName:teamShortName, headshot) %>%\n  mutate(data = map(row_number(), get_qbr_data)) %>% \n  unnest_wider(data) %>% \n  mutate(headshot = pluck(headshot, \"href\"))\n\nglimpse(ex_output)\n\nRows: 30\nColumns: 14\n$ displayName   <chr> \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Drew Bre…\n$ teamName      <chr> \"Ravens\", \"Chiefs\", \"Saints\", \"Cowboys\", \"Sea…\n$ teamShortName <chr> \"BAL\", \"KC\", \"NO\", \"DAL\", \"SEA\", \"DET\", \"HOU\"…\n$ headshot      <chr> \"https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/nfl/player…\n$ TQBR          <dbl> 83.0, 77.7, 73.3, 71.9, 71.5, 71.3, 70.5, 68.…\n$ PA            <dbl> 66.7, 55.8, 33.7, 48.1, 43.0, 27.0, 42.3, 30.…\n$ QBP           <dbl> 613, 585, 419, 690, 674, 353, 662, 620, 374, …\n$ TOT           <dbl> 103.7, 97.3, 62.6, 93.1, 90.9, 56.1, 91.6, 70…\n$ PAS           <dbl> 55.0, 71.6, 53.1, 70.7, 58.3, 44.5, 52.0, 47.…\n$ RUN           <dbl> 39.1, 14.3, 1.6, 10.0, 10.6, 1.6, 19.8, 6.3, …\n$ EXP           <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ PEN           <dbl> 2.2, 5.0, 1.9, 2.6, 1.5, 1.9, 1.4, 3.7, 2.3, …\n$ QBR           <dbl> 82.3, 79.4, 75.7, 72.8, 71.2, 74.7, 71.2, 66.…\n$ SAC           <dbl> -7.4, -6.5, -6.0, -9.7, -20.6, -8.0, -18.5, -…\n\nNow that you have explored the raw data via jsonedit and you see where we are going with this, we can actually try playing around with it in R.\nIt’s Turtles all the way down\nAt it’s heart JSON is essentially nested lists of lists of strings, vectors, or other objects - it’s really just lists full of other objects all the way down.\nWhile there are many reasons WHY JSON is actually a great format for things like… surprise JavaScript! It isn’t the easiest to work with in R for interactive coding as the trusty old dataframe/tibble.\nMy goal today is to show you a few techniques from tidyr that can make quick work of most cleanly structured JSON, although there are weird examples out in the wild of JSON formats that are not as straightforward.\nRaw Data and Libraries\nToday we need the tidyverse and jsonlite packages. We can read in the JSON via jsonlite::fromJSON() on the raw url string. Huge shoutout to ROpenSci, Jeroen Oooms, Duncan Temple Lang, and Lloyd Hilaiel for this package! A basic vignette can be found here.\nFirst off note that I’m using fromJSON() which has simplifyVector = TRUE - this means some lists will automatically get converted to data.frames, matrices, etc. I’ll be using fromJSON() for my example today.\nAfter reviewing this post, Hadley Wickham mentioned that he often prefers jsonlite::read_json() as it doesn’t do this conversion and leaves everything as a list. His approach is at the end of this blogpost.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nurl_json <- \"https://site.web.api.espn.com/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?region=us&lang=en&qbrType=seasons&seasontype=2&isqualified=true&sort=schedAdjQBR%3Adesc&season=2019\"\n\nraw_json <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url_json)\n\nViewing JSON\nI highly recommend that you DON’T blindy call str() on JSON objects - you’ll get several pages of stuff output to your console.\n\nFeel free to try it, as an example exercise, but you’ve been warned. 👀\nI will almost always default to starting with a tool like listviewer::jsonedit() that you get a feel for what the structure looks like. Alternatively, you can use of the examples below to work your way through JSON files more programatically in just R.\nPer my friend Josiah Parry, str() has a max.level argument - this is very helpful for JSON as it lets you slowly expand the depth of what you’re looking at!\nLevel 1\n\n\nstr(raw_json, max.level = 1)\n\nList of 7\n $ pagination     :List of 6\n $ athletes       :'data.frame':    30 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ currentSeason  :List of 5\n $ requestedSeason:List of 5\n $ glossary       :'data.frame':    10 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ categories     :'data.frame':    1 obs. of  6 variables:\n $ currentValues  :List of 13\n\nWe can see that the JSON file at depth 1 has info about the pages returned, athletes in our dataset, what season it is, glossary of terms, categories, and current values.\nHowever some of those lists are actually reporting as lists of lists and lists of dataframes, so let’s try one level deeper.\nLevel 2\nNow we can see that pagination is just character strings of length 1 after two levels, however athletes has: two objects, a dataframe called athlete with 30 rows, and a list called categories is a list of length 30 (which aligns with the length of the athlete dataframe).\nThis is probably the most interesting data to us, as we’re looking for about 30-32 QBs from this API endpoint. Now, how do we actually get at these list objects?\n\n\nstr(raw_json, max.level = 2)\n\nList of 7\n $ pagination     :List of 6\n  ..$ count: int 30\n  ..$ limit: int 50\n  ..$ page : int 1\n  ..$ pages: int 1\n  ..$ first: chr \"http://site.api.espn.com:80/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?isqualified=true&lang=en&qbrtype=seasons&regio\"| __truncated__\n  ..$ last : chr \"http://site.api.espn.com:80/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?isqualified=true&lang=en&qbrtype=seasons&regio\"| __truncated__\n $ athletes       :'data.frame':    30 obs. of  2 variables:\n  ..$ athlete   :'data.frame':  30 obs. of  20 variables:\n  ..$ categories:List of 30\n $ currentSeason  :List of 5\n  ..$ year       : int 2020\n  ..$ displayName: chr \"2020\"\n  ..$ startDate  : chr \"2020-08-05T07:00:00.000+0000\"\n  ..$ endDate    : chr \"2021-02-10T07:59:00.000+0000\"\n  ..$ type       :List of 6\n $ requestedSeason:List of 5\n  ..$ year       : int 2019\n  ..$ displayName: chr \"2019\"\n  ..$ startDate  : chr \"2019-07-31T07:00:00.000+0000\"\n  ..$ endDate    : chr \"2020-02-06T07:59:00.000+0000\"\n  ..$ type       :List of 6\n $ glossary       :'data.frame':    10 obs. of  2 variables:\n  ..$ abbreviation: chr [1:10] \"EXP\" \"PA\" \"PAS\" \"PEN\" ...\n  ..$ displayName : chr [1:10] \"EXP SACK\" \"Points Added\" \"Pass\" \"PENALTY\" ...\n $ categories     :'data.frame':    1 obs. of  6 variables:\n  ..$ name        : chr \"general\"\n  ..$ displayName : chr \"General \"\n  ..$ labels      :List of 1\n  ..$ names       :List of 1\n  ..$ displayNames:List of 1\n  ..$ descriptions:List of 1\n $ currentValues  :List of 13\n  ..$ qbrType    : chr \"seasons\"\n  ..$ sport      : chr \"football\"\n  ..$ league     : chr \"nfl\"\n  ..$ season     : int 2019\n  ..$ seasontype : int 2\n  ..$ week       : NULL\n  ..$ conference : int 9\n  ..$ isQualified: logi TRUE\n  ..$ limit      : int 50\n  ..$ page       : int 1\n  ..$ lang       : chr \"en\"\n  ..$ sort       :List of 2\n  ..$ region     : chr \"us\"\n\nGet at the list\nBecause the JSON file is parsed into R as nested lists, we can access various parts of it through base R with either the $ or with [[ + name. Full details around subsetting lists and vectors are available in Advanced R.\nLet’s try these out by trying to access:\n- raw_json to athletes (raw_json[[\"athletes\"]]) - Looking at it’s structure, again using the max.level argument to prevent extra printing.\nI’d like to note that I’ll be switching back and forth a bit between $ and [[ subsetting, as both accomplish the same thing, where $ is faster to type, but [[ is a bit more strict. Also to access by numerical position, you HAVE to use [[.\n\nAgain, full details around subsetting lists and vectors are available in Advanced R. This is definitely worth reading for edge cases, pitfalls, and lots of nice examples that go beyond the scope of this blog post.\n\n\nraw_json$athletes %>% str(max.level = 1)\n\n'data.frame':   30 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ athlete   :'data.frame': 30 obs. of  20 variables:\n $ categories:List of 30\n\n# this does the same thing!\nraw_json[[\"athletes\"]] %>% str(max.level = 1)\n\n'data.frame':   30 obs. of  2 variables:\n $ athlete   :'data.frame': 30 obs. of  20 variables:\n $ categories:List of 30\n\nAccess the dataframe\nWe can get to the dataframe itself by going one list deeper and we now see a traditional output of str() when called on a dataframe!\n\n\n# json -> list --> dataframe \nraw_json$athletes$athlete %>% str(max.level = 1)\n\n'data.frame':   30 obs. of  20 variables:\n $ id           : chr  \"3916387\" \"3139477\" \"2580\" \"2577417\" ...\n $ uid          : chr  \"s:20~l:28~a:3916387\" \"s:20~l:28~a:3139477\" \"s:20~l:28~a:2580\" \"s:20~l:28~a:2577417\" ...\n $ guid         : chr  \"7d76fbb11c5ed9f4954fcad43f720ae2\" \"37d87523280a9d4a0adb22cfc6d3619c\" \"a3d4f4473aef111aee5c4909a8e70a7c\" \"5f09781b6b0b7325049ba91e60d794e6\" ...\n $ type         : chr  \"football\" \"football\" \"football\" \"football\" ...\n $ firstName    : chr  \"Lamar\" \"Patrick\" \"Drew\" \"Dak\" ...\n $ lastName     : chr  \"Jackson\" \"Mahomes\" \"Brees\" \"Prescott\" ...\n $ displayName  : chr  \"Lamar Jackson\" \"Patrick Mahomes\" \"Drew Brees\" \"Dak Prescott\" ...\n $ shortName    : chr  \"L.

I’m much more interested in the totals and ranks columns as they have length 10.\n\n\n# json -> list -> dataframe -> dataframe w/ list columns!\nraw_json$athletes$categories[[1]]\n\n     name displayName\n1 general    General \n                                                    totals\n1 83.0, 66.7, 613, 103.7, 55.0, 39.1, 0.0, 2.2, 82.3, -7.4\n                         ranks\n1 1, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -, -\n\nSo let’s check out the 3rd column and what is in it. Now if you’re like me, this is starting to feel a bit hairy! We’re 6 levels deep into one object and this is just 1 output of a total of 30!\nStick with me for one more example and then we’ll get into purrr!\n\n\nraw_json$athletes$categories[[1]][3][[1]]\n\n[[1]]\n [1] \"83.0\"  \"66.7\"  \"613\"   \"103.7\" \"55.0\"  \"39.1\"  \"0.0\"   \"2.2\"  \n [9] \"82.3\"  \"-7.4\" \n\nSo we know:\n- The QB names and teams (raw_json$athletes$athlete)\n- Their stats are in a different part of the JSON file (aw_json$athletes$categories)\nIf you wanted to you could combine the athlete dataframe with their stats with a for loop. There are additional way of optimizing this (potentially convert to matrix and then to data.frame), but I just want to show that it’s possible and fairly readable! An example with lapply is below as well. Note that since we’re not pre-allocating our data.frame, this is likely the slowest method. It’s ok for our 30 iteration example, but is likely not the best strategy for large JSON files.\n\n\ndf_interest <- raw_json$athletes$athlete[c(\"displayName\", \"teamName\", \"teamShortName\")]\n\nlength_df <- nrow(df_interest)\n\npbp_out <- data.frame()\n\ncategory_names <- raw_json[[\"categories\"]][[\"labels\"]][[1]]\n\nfor (i in 1:length_df){\n  # grab each QBs stats and convert to a vector of type double\n  raw_vec <- as.double(raw_json$athletes$categories[[i]]$totals[[1]])\n  \n  # split each stat into it's own list with the proper name\n  split_vec <- split(raw_vec, category_names)\n  \n  # convert the list into a dataframe \n  pbp_df_loop <- cbind.data.frame(split_vec)\n  \n  # combine the 30 QB's stats into the empty data.frame\n  pbp_out <- rbind(pbp_out, pbp_df_loop)\n}\n\n# combine our loop-created df w/ the QB names/team\nfinal_loop_df <- cbind(df_interest, pbp_out)\n\n# take a peek at the result!\nglimpse(final_loop_df)\n\nRows: 30\nColumns: 13\n$ displayName   <chr> \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Drew Bre…\n$ teamName      <chr> \"Ravens\", \"Chiefs\", \"Saints\", \"Cowboys\", \"Sea…\n$ teamShortName <chr> \"BAL\", \"KC\", \"NO\", \"DAL\", \"SEA\", \"DET\", \"HOU\"…\n$ EXP           <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ PA            <dbl> 66.7, 55.8, 33.7, 48.1, 43.0, 27.0, 42.3, 30.…\n$ PAS           <dbl> 55.0, 71.6, 53.1, 70.7, 58.3, 44.5, 52.0, 47.…\n$ PEN           <dbl> 2.2, 5.0, 1.9, 2.6, 1.5, 1.9, 1.4, 3.7, 2.3, …\n$ QBP           <dbl> 613, 585, 419, 690, 674, 353, 662, 620, 374, …\n$ QBR           <dbl> 82.3, 79.4, 75.7, 72.8, 71.2, 74.7, 71.2, 66.…\n$ RUN           <dbl> 39.1, 14.3, 1.6, 10.0, 10.6, 1.6, 19.8, 6.3, …\n$ SAC           <dbl> -7.4, -6.5, -6.0, -9.7, -20.6, -8.0, -18.5, -…\n$ TOT           <dbl> 103.7, 97.3, 62.6, 93.1, 90.9, 56.1, 91.6, 70…\n$ TQBR          <dbl> 83.0, 77.7, 73.3, 71.9, 71.5, 71.3, 70.5, 68.…\n\nLet’s try this again, but with a function and iterating that function with lapply.\n\n\n# extract the core name dataframe\ndf_interest <- raw_json$athletes$athlete[c(\"displayName\", \"teamName\", \"teamShortName\")]\n\n# how many rows?\nlength_df <- nrow(df_interest)\n\n# category names again\ncategory_names <- raw_json[[\"categories\"]][[\"labels\"]][[1]]\n\n# create a function to apply\nqbr_stat_fun <- function(qb_num){\n  # grab each QBs stats and convert to a vector of type double\n  raw_vec <- as.double(raw_json$athletes$categories[[qb_num]]$totals[[1]])\n  \n  # split each stat into it's own list with the proper name\n  split_vec <- split(raw_vec, category_names)\n  \n  # return the lists\n  split_vec\n}\n\n# use apply to generate list of lists\nlist_qbr_stats <- lapply(1:length_df, qbr_stat_fun)\n\n# Combine the lists into a dataframe\nlist_pbp_df <- do.call(\"rbind.data.frame\", list_qbr_stats)\n\n# cbind the names with the stats\ncbind(df_interest, list_pbp_df) %>% glimpse()\n\nRows: 30\nColumns: 13\n$ displayName   <chr> \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Drew Bre…\n$ teamName      <chr> \"Ravens\", \"Chiefs\", \"Saints\", \"Cowboys\", \"Sea…\n$ teamShortName <chr> \"BAL\", \"KC\", \"NO\", \"DAL\", \"SEA\", \"DET\", \"HOU\"…\n$ EXP           <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ PA            <dbl> 66.7, 55.8, 33.7, 48.1, 43.0, 27.0, 42.3, 30.…\n$ PAS           <dbl> 55.0, 71.6, 53.1, 70.7, 58.3, 44.5, 52.0, 47.…\n$ PEN           <dbl> 2.2, 5.0, 1.9, 2.6, 1.5, 1.9, 1.4, 3.7, 2.3, …\n$ QBP           <dbl> 613, 585, 419, 690, 674, 353, 662, 620, 374, …\n$ QBR           <dbl> 82.3, 79.4, 75.7, 72.8, 71.2, 74.7, 71.2, 66.…\n$ RUN           <dbl> 39.1, 14.3, 1.6, 10.0, 10.6, 1.6, 19.8, 6.3, …\n$ SAC           <dbl> -7.4, -6.5, -6.0, -9.7, -20.6, -8.0, -18.5, -…\n$ TOT           <dbl> 103.7, 97.3, 62.6, 93.1, 90.9, 56.1, 91.6, 70…\n$ TQBR          <dbl> 83.0, 77.7, 73.3, 71.9, 71.5, 71.3, 70.5, 68.…\n\nNow, I typically don’t suggest using a for loop as per Advanced R this approach can be prone to some common pitfalls which can lead to performance deficits or side effects. Similarily, the apply family of functions are very powerful but for some folks they find that it doesn’t quite fit with their mental model or is inconsistent in the expected output.\nAs an alternative to loops and/or apply, we can use purrr, AND purrr can also help us a lot with actually parsing through the JSON itself! I also think that other tidyverse tools like tidyr for unnest_wider and unpack/hoist are useful here as alternative strategies!\nEnter purrr\npurrr is usually thought of for using functional programming as alternatives to for loops and for the concept of “Iteration without repetition”. Overviews of purrr are covered a bit deeper in R4DS and in one of my previous blog posts.\npurrr::pluck()\nThe first function from purrr we’ll use is pluck, which provides a consistent and generalized form of [[. This allows you to quickly move through lists and nested lists.\nLet’s get back to our QB dataframe with pluck! There are still a lot of columns we don’t need, but we’ll get rid of those when we put all the data together.\n\n\nraw_json %>% \n  # equivalent to raw_json[[\"athletes\"]][[\"athlete\"]]\n  purrr::pluck(\"athletes\", \"athlete\") %>% \n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 30\nColumns: 20\n$ id            <chr> \"3916387\", \"3139477\", \"2580\", \"2577417\", \"148…\n$ uid           <chr> \"s:20~l:28~a:3916387\", \"s:20~l:28~a:3139477\",…\n$ guid          <chr> \"7d76fbb11c5ed9f4954fcad43f720ae2\", \"37d87523…\n$ type          <chr> \"football\", \"football\", \"football\", \"football…\n$ firstName     <chr> \"Lamar\", \"Patrick\", \"Drew\", \"Dak\", \"Russell\",…\n$ lastName      <chr> \"Jackson\", \"Mahomes\", \"Brees\", \"Prescott\", \"W…\n$ displayName   <chr> \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Drew Bre…\n$ shortName     <chr> \"L.

We’ll define this as get_qbr_data() and test it out! It gets us a nicely extracted named numeric vector. The names are useful as when we go to unnest_wider() the dataset it will automatically assign the column names for us.\n\n\n# get names of the QBR categories with pluck\ncategory_names <- pluck(raw_json, \"categories\", \"labels\", 1)\n\ncategory_names\n\n [1] \"TQBR\" \"PA\"   \"QBP\"  \"TOT\"  \"PAS\"  \"RUN\"  \"EXP\"  \"PEN\"  \"QBR\" \n[10] \"SAC\" \n\n# Get the QBR stats by each player (row_n = row number of player in the df)\nget_qbr_data <- function(row_n) {\n  purrr::pluck(raw_json, \"athletes\", \"categories\", row_n, \"totals\", 1) %>% \n    # convert from character to double\n    as.double() %>% \n    # assign names from category\n    set_names(nm = category_names)\n}\n\n# test the function\nget_qbr_data(1)\n\n TQBR    PA   QBP   TOT   PAS   RUN   EXP   PEN   QBR   SAC \n 83.0  66.7 613.0 103.7  55.0  39.1   0.0   2.2  82.3  -7.4 \n\nNote, while this looks like a 1x10 dataframe, it’s still just a vector with name attributes.\n\n\n# What type?\nget_qbr_data(1) %>% str()\n\n Named num [1:10] 83 66.7 613 103.7 55 ...\n - attr(*, \"names\")= chr [1:10] \"TQBR\" \"PA\" \"QBP\" \"TOT\" ...\n\nPut it all together\nWe can use our defined function, purrr::pluck() and purrr::map to build our final dataframe!\nLet’s start by extracting the core dataframe with player name, team name, and for extra fun, the headshot which is a listed dataframe column!\n\n\n# create the dataframe and tidy it up\npbp_df <- pluck(raw_json, \"athletes\", \"athlete\") %>%\n  # convert to tibble\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  # select columns of interest\n  select(displayName, teamName:teamShortName, headshot)\n\n# print it\npbp_df\n\n# A tibble: 30 x 4\n   displayName  teamName teamShortName headshot$href           $alt   \n   <chr>        <chr>    <chr>         <chr>                   <chr>  \n 1 Lamar Jacks… Ravens   BAL           https://a.espncdn.com/… Lamar …\n 2 Patrick Mah… Chiefs   KC            https://a.espncdn.com/… Patric…\n 3 Drew Brees   Saints   NO            https://a.espncdn.com/… Drew B…\n 4 Dak Prescott Cowboys  DAL           https://a.espncdn.com/… Dak Pr…\n 5 Russell Wil… Seahawks SEA           https://a.espncdn.com/… Russel…\n 6 Matthew Sta… Lions    DET           https://a.espncdn.com/… Matthe…\n 7 Deshaun Wat… Texans   HOU           https://a.espncdn.com/… Deshau…\n 8 Ryan Fitzpa… Dolphins MIA           https://a.espncdn.com/… Ryan F…\n 9 Ryan Tanneh… Titans   TEN           https://a.espncdn.com/… Ryan T…\n10 Derek Carr   Raiders  OAK           https://a.espncdn.com/… Derek …\n# … with 20 more rows\n\nNow we can use our get_qbr_data() to do just that and grab the data from the categories/totals portion of the JSON.

With tidyr::unnest() and tidyr::hoist() this is easy to work with!\nDon’t forget to check out the rectangling guide from the tidyverse team.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n# link to the API output as a JSON file\nurl_json <- \"https://site.web.api.espn.com/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?region=us&lang=en&qbrType=seasons&seasontype=2&isqualified=true&sort=schedAdjQBR%3Adesc&season=2019\"\n\n# get the raw json into R\nraw_json_list <- jsonlite::read_json(url_json)\n\n# get names of the QBR categories\ncategory_names <- pluck(raw_json_list, \"categories\", 1, \"labels\")\n\n# create tibble out of athlete objects\nathletes <- tibble(athlete = pluck(raw_json_list, \"athletes\"))\n\nqbr_hadley <- athletes %>% \n  unnest_wider(athlete) %>% \n  hoist(athlete, \"displayName\", \"teamName\", \"teamShortName\") %>% \n  unnest_longer(categories) %>% \n  hoist(categories, \"totals\") %>% \n  mutate(totals = map(totals, as.double),\n         totals = map(totals, set_names, category_names)) %>% \n  unnest_wider(totals) %>% \n  hoist(athlete, headshot = list(\"headshot\", \"href\")) %>% \n  select(-athlete, -categories)\n\n# Is it the same as my version?\nall.equal(final_pluck, qbr_hadley)\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nTLDR\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\n# link to the API output as a JSON file\nurl_json <- \"https://site.web.api.espn.com/apis/fitt/v3/sports/football/nfl/qbr?region=us&lang=en&qbrType=seasons&seasontype=2&isqualified=true&sort=schedAdjQBR%3Adesc&season=2019\"\n\n# get the raw json into R\nraw_json <- jsonlite::fromJSON(url_json)\n\n# get names of the QBR categories\ncategory_names <- pluck(raw_json, \"categories\", \"labels\", 1)\n\n# Get the QBR stats by each player (row_n = player)\nget_qbr_data <- function(row_n) {\n  purrr::pluck(raw_json, \"athletes\", \"categories\", row_n, \"totals\", 1) %>% \n    as.double() %>% \n    set_names(nm = category_names)\n}\n\n# create the dataframe and tidy it up\nex_output <- pluck(raw_json, \"athletes\", \"athlete\") %>%\n  as_tibble() %>%\n  select(displayName, teamName:teamShortName, headshot) %>%\n  mutate(data = map(row_number(), get_qbr_data)) %>% \n  unnest_wider(data) %>% \n  mutate(headshot = pluck(headshot, \"href\"))\n\nglimpse(ex_output)\n\nRows: 30\nColumns: 14\n$ displayName   <chr> \"Lamar Jackson\", \"Patrick Mahomes\", \"Drew Bre…\n$ teamName      <chr> \"Ravens\", \"Chiefs\", \"Saints\", \"Cowboys\", \"Sea…\n$ teamShortName <chr> \"BAL\", \"KC\", \"NO\", \"DAL\", \"SEA\", \"DET\", \"HOU\"…\n$ headshot      <chr> \"https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/nfl/player…\n$ TQBR          <dbl> 83.0, 77.7, 73.3, 71.9, 71.5, 71.3, 70.5, 68.…\n$ PA            <dbl> 66.7, 55.8, 33.7, 48.1, 43.0, 27.0, 42.3, 30.…\n$ QBP           <dbl> 613, 585, 419, 690, 674, 353, 662, 620, 374, …\n$ TOT           <dbl> 103.7, 97.3, 62.6, 93.1, 90.9, 56.1, 91.6, 70…\n$ PAS           <dbl> 55.0, 71.6, 53.1, 70.7, 58.3, 44.5, 52.0, 47.…\n$ RUN           <dbl> 39.1, 14.3, 1.6, 10.0, 10.6, 1.6, 19.8, 6.3, …\n$ EXP           <dbl> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …\n$ PEN           <dbl> 2.2, 5.0, 1.9, 2.6, 1.5, 1.9, 1.4, 3.7, 2.3, …\n$ QBR           <dbl> 82.3, 79.4, 75.7, 72.8, 71.2, 74.7, 71.2, 66.…\n$ SAC           <dbl> -7.4, -6.5, -6.0, -9.7, -20.6, -8.0, -18.5, -…\n\n\n\n",

Reference & Over the Cap\nComponent parts of a gt tablePer the package website, gt has the following component parts:\n\nThe parts (roughly from top to bottom) are:\nthe Table Header (optional; with a title and possibly a subtitle)\nthe Stub and the Stub Head (optional; contains row labels, optionally within row groups having row group labels and possibly summary labels when a summary is present)\nthe Column Labels (contains column labels, optionally under spanner column labels)\nthe Table Body (contains columns and rows of cells)\nthe Table Footer (optional; possibly with footnotes and source notes)\n\nAs you can see it is fleshing out the idea of formatting or adding various parts of the table in a robust way.\n\nRead in the Data\nI’ve gone through collecting the data and have

formatting for Total Appearances and Salary\n- Change the fonts\n- Add borders\nConditional Colors\nWe covered conditional colors in the previous post - check it out if you have further questions about building or using palettes.\nA MAJOR value add that gt provides is rather than having to write our own palette parser it has a built in one via gt::data_color()! Just to refresh us on our palette, we’re using an adaptation of the viridis palette.\n\n\nscales::show_col(c(\"#ffffff\", \"#f2fbd2\", \"#c9ecb4\", \"#93d3ab\", \"#35b0ab\"))\n\n\nFor today’s example, we’ll use one from paletteer as well! Notice that printing paletteer::d() directly attaches the colors in the console, and to use it as a plain old character vector, we’ll need to wrap it in as.character() OR pipe it forward like palette %>% as.character().\n\nAs a reminder, paletteer is a meta-package of MOST of the palettes available through packages in R.\n\n\npaletteer::paletteer_d(\"ggsci::red_material\", n = 6) %>%\n  as.character() %>%\n  scales::show_col()\n\n\nI’d also like to introduce a function to generate colors from the scales package. scales::col_numeric() can generate continuous color scales based off a vector of colors. Notice that it operates differently than our other color function that is normalized between 0 and 1. This one takes ANY number and should be used with a vector of numbers. Notice the behavior with single colors generates the same color every time (nothing to scale against since we used domain = NULL).\n\n\nred_color_generator <- scales::col_numeric(c(\"red\", \"white\"), domain = NULL)\n\nred_color_generator(50) %>% scales::show_col()\n\n\nHowever, if you pass a vector to this, you get the expected behavior!\n\n\nred_color_generator(seq(10, 60, by = 10)) %>% scales::show_col()\n\n\nAlternatively, you could define domain to be part of the range of your values. This is expanded with example code below\n\n\n# Define a specific range color generator\nred_color_generator_ranged <- scales::col_numeric(c(\"red\", \"white\"), domain = c(0, 100))\n\n# define a few points along the range\ncloser_to_red <- red_color_generator_ranged(25)\nbetween_red_white <- red_color_generator_ranged(50)\ncloser_to_white <- red_color_generator_ranged(75)\n\n# combine and show colors\nc(closer_to_red, between_red_white, closer_to_white) %>% scales::show_col()\n\n\nYou could imagine doing something like below for the domain setting. However, again note that we don’t really need to define domain for our example here. gt will pass the data column through to the data_color() function into scales::col_numeric() directly as a vector.\n\n\n# Base version\nmy_domain <- c(min(df$col_of_interest), max(df$col_of_interest))\n\n# OR\n\n# tidyverse version if you wanted to try it that way\nmy_domain <- c(\n  summarize(df, min = min(col_of_interest)) %>% pull(min),\n  summarize(df, max = max(col_of_interest)) %>% pull(max)\n)\n\nred_color_generator_ranged <- scales::col_numeric(c(\"red\", \"white\"),\n  domain = my_domain\n)\n\nFormat by value\ngt has a built in function to color data cells - based on either logical or based on a continuous scale. You can use R functions or additional packages to generate indeterminate length palettes.\nThe core table is seen below with comments added to highlight some emphasized changes.\n\n\nplayoff_salary

Notice that gt takes glue style string parsing, so you can use the pattern argument to add trailing or leading text input as you like.\nFor example pattern = \"{x} MIL\" would convert 125.1 to $125.1 MIL.

We’ll use tab_style() to accomplish this, and gt has a cell_borders() function to control formatting of:\n- Location & Side\n- Color & Weight\nSo we tell gt to style the cell borders to black, attach to the left side of the cell, make it “heavier” at 3 pixels (px(3)), with the location in the cell body of the Total column. See below for the code that accomplishes this. We do a separate call to add a black border below the column labels.\n\n\nplayoff_salary %>%\n  head() %>%\n  gt() %>%\n  data_color(\n    columns = vars(salary),\n    colors = scales::col_numeric(\n

and adding a header w/ title and subtitle.\ngt::cols_label() allows us to change the title of specific columns ad hoc, similar to dplyr::rename(), while tab_source_note() adds a source note at the bottom of the table, and tab_header() adds an optional title and subtitle. Notice that we can use md() to parse markdown syntax within these text strings. I can make things bold with this markdown syntax like: md(\"**text**\").\nNote that at this point, I’m essentially done with the table so I have removed the head() call to show the full table. Our data_color() formatting expands to match the new colors, and all of our formatting thus far is good to go!\n\n\ncomplete_table <- playoff_salary %>%\n  # REMOVED head() %>%\n  gt() %>%\n

@THOMAS_MOCK | DATA: PRO FOOTBALL REFERENCE & OVER THE CAP\n    \n\nExtra Customization & Fonts\nNote that the above table is essentially done - it’s 90% of the way to a fully custom table. It has all the core changes we wanted (conditional color, titles, and borders). Everything below is extra1 and you can see that just like customizing a ggplot it’s straight-forward but there is quite a bit of code to add to get the last 10% towards your truly custom end product.\nHowever, note that since this is a static table - you don’t need to use HTML, CSS or JS to do customizations and everything is done in R and mostly through built in to gt function calls!\nImport Google Font\nI want to use a Google font (Karla + Fira Mono).\nYou can see all the Google Fonts here. At fonts.google.com you’ll:\n- Search for specific fonts\n- Select the Style you want (+ button)\n- Open the sidebar to download the fonts locally\n- Import the fonts into your system (varies by Mac, Windows, Linux) – I use extrafont for this, but there are numerous ways, packages like gfonts allow you to use Google fonts in RMD or Shiny for example\nI’m on a Mac, so I import the fonts to my Font Book (guide here) and then use extrafont::font_import(pattern = \"Karla\") to import them to R and register them for things like ggplot2 or gt. Hopefully in the future the systemfonts package will take care of this but for now that’s my workflow.\n\n\n# not run (I already have them locally)\nextrafont::font_import(pattern =

For more info about using color to represent data values check out Claus Wilke’s book section. Importantly - we want a sequential/continuous color scale.\nPer Claus:\n\nSuch a scale contains a sequence of colors that clearly indicate (i) which values are larger or smaller than which other ones and (ii) how distant two specific values are from each other. The second point implies that the color scale needs to be perceived to vary uniformly across its entire range.\nSequential scales can be based on a single hue (e.g., from dark blue to light blue) or on multiple hues (e.g., from dark red to light yellow) (Figure 4.3). Multi-hue scales tend to follow color gradients that can be seen in the natural world, such as dark red, green, or blue to light yellow, or dark purple to light green. The reverse, e.g. dark yellow to light blue, looks unnatural and doesn’t make a useful sequential scale.\n\nFigure 4.3Now there are plenty of palettes to choose from, such as viridis, RColorBrewer, ggthemes, as well as a nice meta collection via paletteer!\nNow it’s often hard to keep track of these palettes and what they actually look like.\nTo display ANY palette or vector of colors in R you can use scales::show_col() - scales comes along with ggplot2 & the tidyverse, so you probably don’t need to install it (just load it)! Reference: StackOverflow and scales.\n\n\nlibrary(scales)\n\nscales::show_col(c(\"red\", \"black\", \"blue\", \"purple\"))\n\n\nscales::show_col() also works with palettes/vectors.\n\n\nviridis::viridis(n = 16) %>% \n  scales::show_col()\n\n\nscales::show_col() also works with paletteer or really any other palette package to display palettes/vectors. You just need to supply > 1 color as a character vector and you’re good to go!\n\n\n\"ggsci::red_material\" %>% \n  paletteer::paletteer_d(., n = 9) %>% \n  scales::show_col()\n\n\nNow that we understand how to show colors, I’ll explain a bit more about our coloring function.\nColor Function\nI borrowed my function to generate colors scales through grDevices::colorRamp() from Greg Lin’s examples. This makes use of colorRamp to generate a sequence of colors and then pull them according to a sliding scale normalized to 0-1.\n\n\n# greg's palette\nscales::show_col(c(\"#ffffff\", \"#f2fbd2\", \"#c9ecb4\", \"#93d3ab\", \"#35b0ab\"))\n\n\nBack to our color scale, we can display an example step-by-step.\n\n\n# Function by Greg Lin\n# Notice bias here = a positive number. \n# Higher values give more widely spaced colors at the high end\n\nmake_color_pal <- function(colors, bias = 1) {\n  get_color <- colorRamp(colors, bias = bias)\n  function(x) rgb(get_color(x), maxColorValue = 255)\n}\n\ngood_color <- make_color_pal(c(\"#ffffff\", \"#f2fbd2\", \"#c9ecb4\", \"#93d3ab\", \"#35b0ab\"), bias = 2)\n\n# Generate a vector of example numbers between 0 and 1\nseq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 12)\n\n [1] 0.1000000 0.1727273 0.2454545 0.3181818 0.3909091 0.4636364\n [7] 0.5363636 0.6090909 0.6818182 0.7545455 0.8272727 0.9000000\n\n# create matching colors\ngood_color(seq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 12))\n\n [1] \"#E9F8CB\" \"#D9F2C0\" \"#C9ECB4\" \"#BDE6B2\" \"#B0E0AF\" \"#A4DAAD\"\n [7] \"#97D5AB\" \"#88CFAB\" \"#79C9AB\" \"#69C3AB\" \"#5ABDAB\" \"#4AB8AB\"\n\n# display the colors\nseq(0.1, 0.9, length.out = 12) %>% \n  good_color() %>% \n  scales::show_col()\n\n\nThe palette that Greg and FiveThirtyEight used for this plot is roughly similar to the lower half of viridis - a commonly used continuous color scale that is mostly color-blind friendly.\n\n\n\nFormat by value\nreactable has a section on conditional styling - either logical or based on a continuous scale. You can use R or JavaScript functions to change the style of cells.\nThe core table is seen below with comments added to highlight some emphasized changes.\n\n\nplayoff_salary %>% \n  mutate(salary = round(salary, 1)) %>% \n    \n    ##########################\n    ### This section changed\n    ##########################\n  reactable(\n    # ALL one page option (no scrolling or page swapping)\n    pagination = TRUE,\n    # compact for an overall smaller table width wise\n    compact = TRUE,\n    # borderless - TRUE or FALSE\n    borderless = FALSE,\n    # Stripes - TRUE or FALSE\n    striped = FALSE,\n    # fullWidth - either fit to width or not\n    fullWidth = FALSE,\n    # apply defaults\n    # 100 px and align to center of column\n    defaultColDef = colDef(\n      align = \"center\",\n      minWidth = 100\n    ))\n\n{\"x\":{\"tag\":{\"name\":\"Reactable\",\"attribs\":{\"data\":{\"player\":[\"Tom Brady\",\"Aaron Rodgers\",\"Russell Wilson\",\"Ben Roethlisberger\",\"Alex Smith\",\"Andrew Luck\",\"Cam Newton\",\"Dak Prescott\",\"Deshaun Watson\",\"Drew Brees\",\"Kirk Cousins\",\"Marcus Mariota\",\"Matt Ryan\",\"Matt Stafford\",\"Patrick Mahomes\",\"Peyton Manning\",\"Andy Dalton\",\"Blake Bortles\",\"Brian Hoyer\",\"Brock Osweiler\",\"Carson Palmer\",\"Carson Wentz\",\"Case Keenum\",\"Eli Manning\",\"Jared Goff\",\"Jimmy Garoppolo\",\"Joe Flacco\",\"Josh Allen\",\"Lamar Jackson\",\"Mitchell Trubisky\",\"Nick Foles\",\"Philip Rivers\",\"Ryan Tannehill\",\"Teddy Bridgewater\",\"Tony Romo\",\"Tyrod Taylor\"],\"Wildcard\":[1,2,4,3,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],\"Division\":[5,4,4,3,2,2,2,2,1,2,1,1,2,0,2,2,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,0],\"Conference\":[5,3,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0],\"Superbowl\":[4,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\"Total\":[15,9,10,7,4,5,6,3,3,5,3,3,5,2,5,4,1,3,1,2,2,1,2,1,4,3,2,1,2,1,2,2,3,1,2,1],\"salary\":[100.1,125.6,91.1,127.7,93.7,75.3,104.4,4,9.4,125.2,98.4,45.1,118,129.7,11.2,35,80,31.7,12.9,15.6,62.9,26.6,24.7,124.2,29.7,59.8,106.1,8.7,3.9,19.8,33.8,117.3,51.2,12.4,47.6,37.7]},\"columns\":[{\"accessor\":\"player\",\"name\":\"player\",\"type\":\"character\",\"minWidth\":100,\"align\":\"center\"},{\"accessor\":\"Wildcard\",\"name\":\"Wildcard\",\"type\":\"numeric\",\"minWidth\":100,\"align\":\"center\"},{\"accessor\":\"Division\",\"name\":\"Division\",\"type\":\"numeric\",\"minWidth\":100,\"align\":\"center\"},{\"accessor\":\"Conference\",\"name\":\"Conference\",\"type\":\"numeric\",\"minWidth\":100,\"align\":\"center\"},{\"accessor\":\"Superbowl\",\"name\":\"Superbowl\",\"type\":\"numeric\",\"minWidth\":100,\"align\":\"center\"},{\"accessor\":\"Total\",\"name\":\"Total\",\"type\":\"numeric\",\"minWidth\":100,\"align\":\"center\"},{\"accessor\":\"salary\",\"name\":\"salary\",\"type\":\"numeric\",\"minWidth\":100,\"align\":\"center\"}],\"defaultPageSize\":10,\"paginationType\":\"numbers\",\"showPageInfo\":true,\"minRows\":1,\"compact\":true,\"inline\":true,\"dataKey\":\"3dbbabb8e22c8f5425b0bb5ed84cc6bb\"},\"children\":[]},\"class\":\"reactR_markup\"},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}\nTo actually change the color according to our color scale, we can use the below code.

While this typically is used for some type of group as seen in the tidymodels docs, we can also do it for running many models at once from a wide dataset.\nOur goal is to get all of the measures into a long form tibble so that we can fit all of the models at once, and plot it all at once.\nBasic Example\nThis basic example is borrowed directly from the tidymodels docs.\nFirst you nest the data by a grouping variable to get list-columns of each split data/tibble.\n\n\nmtcars <- as_tibble(mtcars)  # to play nicely with list-cols\n\nnest_mtcars <- mtcars %>%\n  nest(data = c(-am)) \n\nnest_mtcars\n\n# A tibble: 2 x 2\n     am data              \n  <dbl> <list>            \n1     1 <tibble [13 × 10]>\n2     0 <tibble [19 × 10]>\n\nNow you can apply a lm() call w/ purrr::map() to each dataset, and then broom::tidy() the model output!\n\n\nnest_mtcars %>% \n  mutate(\n    fit = map(data, ~ lm(wt ~ mpg + qsec + gear, data = .x)),  # S3 list-col\n    tidied = map(fit, tidy)\n  ) %>% \n  unnest(tidied) %>% \n  select(-data, -fit)\n\n# A tibble: 8 x 6\n     am term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <dbl> <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1     1 (Intercept)   4.28      3.46      1.24   0.247   \n2     1 mpg          -0.101     0.0294   -3.43   0.00750 \n3     1 qsec          0.0398    0.151     0.264  0.798   \n4     1 gear         -0.0229    0.349    -0.0656 0.949   \n5     0 (Intercept)   4.92      1.40      3.52   0.00309 \n6     0 mpg          -0.192     0.0443   -4.33   0.000591\n7     0 qsec          0.0919    0.0983    0.935  0.365   \n8     0 gear          0.147     0.368     0.398  0.696   \n\nNow each of the model metrics for automatic vs manual transmissions (0 vs 1) is easy to work with! We’ll use a similar approach (nest-map-unnest) albeit with a slightly different data structure for our following analysis.\nNFL Example\nWe’ll be performing a similar analysis to what Josh Hermsmeyer’s did in his 538 article. The raw code for his analysis is available on his GitHub. Essentially he evaluated how stable metrics were year-over-year, by comparing:\nMetric in Year N\nMetric in Year N + 1\nWe’re skipping most of the nflscrapR aggregation (see the link for full script), the portion we can change a bit to make our lives easier is the repeated modeling.\nRather than having to generate a model for every metric one-by-one, we can generate the models for ALL the metrics in the datase at once, while still running the model just for each metric by the following year’s metric.\n\n\n### QB Hits model  ------------------------------------------------------------\n\nqb_hits_model <- lm(data = team_defense_joined, qb_hit.y ~ qb_hit.x)\n\nqb_hits_stability <- glance(qb_hits_model) %>%\n   mutate(metric = \"QB Hits\",\n          r.squared = round(r.squared, 3)) %>%\n   select(metric, r.squared)\n\nGet the data\nSo let’s load our libraries and get to modeling!\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # all the things\nlibrary(espnscrapeR) # NFL data summaries\nlibrary(broom) # tidy modeling\nlibrary(glue) # nice string creation\nlibrary(ggtext) # for formatted text in ggplot\n\nFirst we’ll get all the data from the 2000-2019 seasons for NFL offenses via espnscrapeR::scrape_team_stats_nfl().\n\n\n# Get data from espnscrapeR\nall_off <- 2000:2019 %>% \n  map_dfr(scrape_team_stats_nfl)\n\nglimpse(all_off)\n\nRows: 626\nColumns: 19\n$ season         <int> 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 2000, 20…\n$ role           <chr> \"OFFENSE\", \"OFFENSE\", \"OFFENSE\", \"OFFENSE\", …\n$ stat           <chr> \"PASSING\", \"PASSING\", \"PASSING\", \"PASSING\", …\n$ team           <chr> \"Redskins\", \"Buccaneers\", \"Seahawks\", \"49ers…\n$ pass_att       <int> 561, 433, 507, 583, 578, 439, 554, 575, 637,…\n$ pass_comp      <int> 343, 237, 308, 366, 311, 217, 316, 331, 352,…\n$ pass_comp_pct  <dbl> 0.611, 0.547, 0.607, 0.628, 0.538, 0.494, 0.…\n$ yds_att        <dbl> 6.9, 6.5, 6.3, 7.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 5.9, 6.3,…\n$ pass_yds       <int> 3892, 2824, 3198, 4400, 3540, 2738, 3478, 33…\n$ pass_td        <int> 18, 18, 21, 32, 19, 12, 16, 21, 23, 22, 22, …\n$ int            <int> 21, 13, 21, 10, 30, 10, 24, 15, 29, 13, 15, …\n$ pass_rating    <dbl> 77.0, 76.2, 75.5, 97.0, 61.8, 68.9, 67.4, 75…\n$ first_downs    <int> 185, 144, 168, 211, 156, 128, 156, 182, 192,…\n$ pass_first_pct <dbl> 0.330, 0.333, 0.331, 0.362, 0.270, 0.292, 0.…\n$ pass_20plus    <int> 43, 38, 26, 61, 41, 37, 41, 46, 50, 46, 42, …\n$ pass_40plus    <int> 10, 5, 7, 9, 9, 3, 11, 5, 8, 7, 8, 5, 13, 8,…\n$ pass_long      <chr> \"77T\", \"75\", \"71\", \"69T\", \"83T\", \"77T\", \"70T…\n$ sacks          <int> 32, 38, 46, 25, 53, 43, 35, 45, 20, 28, 39, …\n$ sack_yds       <int> 244, 241, 238, 161, 302, 220, 228, 262, 99, …\n\nPivot the data longer\nBecause we are looking to run all the models at once, we’ll need to take the data structure from wide to longer, so we can nest() the datasets by metric and run the model on each metric pair. By pivoting to long format we get our team-level data by season and metric with the corresponding value of each season.\n\n\nlong_off_stats <- all_off %>% \n  select(team, pass_att:sacks, season,-pass_long, -pass_comp) %>% \n  mutate(season2 = season + 1) %>% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(-team, -season, -season2), \n    names_to = \"metric\", \n    values_to = \"value\")\n\nlong_off_stats\n\n# A tibble: 7,512 x 5\n   team     season season2 metric            value\n   <chr>     <int>   <dbl> <chr>             <dbl>\n 1 Redskins   2000    2001 pass_att        561    \n 2 Redskins   2000    2001 pass_comp_pct     0.611\n 3 Redskins   2000    2001 yds_att           6.9  \n 4 Redskins   2000    2001 pass_yds       3892    \n 5 Redskins   2000    2001 pass_td          18    \n 6 Redskins   2000    2001 int              21    \n 7 Redskins   2000    2001 pass_rating      77    \n 8 Redskins   2000    2001 first_downs     185    \n 9 Redskins   2000    2001 pass_first_pct    0.33 \n10 Redskins   2000    2001 pass_20plus      43    \n# … with 7,502 more rows\n\nJoin the data\nNext we need to join the data back into itself to get the matched value 1 (year) with value 2 (year + 1). The join renames value on the left-hand side (value.x) and the right-hand side (value.y).

Let’s look at it all together now. We rearranged the dataset, nested, ran 9 models, and got our outputs in one pipe with just a few lines of code!\n\n\n(off_stability <- long_off_stats %>% \n    inner_join(long_off_stats, by = c(\"season2\" = \"season\", \"team\", \"metric\")) %>% \n    select(everything(), -season2.y) %>% \n    nest(data = c(-metric)) %>% \n    mutate(\n      fit = map(data, ~ lm(value.y ~ value.x, data = .x)),\n      glanced = map(fit, glance)\n    ) %>% \n    hoist(glanced, r.squared = \"r.squared\") %>% \n    arrange(desc(r.squared)) %>% \n    mutate(metric_label = glue::glue(\"{metric} (R^2 = {round(r.squared, 3)})\")))\n\nPlot it\nNow there’s another advantage to getting data into this longer format!\nWe can combine our labels that we generated with glue and the long-form data to plot ALL of the raw metrics at once with one ggplot. Note I have added an example line in light grey (slope = 1 for perfect fit) and a red-line for the lm for each dataset. That’s all for this example, but hopefully that opened your eyes to a nest-map-unnest workflow even for relatively simple models!\nI’d definitely recommend trying out the rest of the tidymodels ecosystem for your more advanced machine learning and statistical analyses. You can learn all about it at the tidymodels.org site.\n\n\n(off_plot <- long_off_stats %>% \n    inner_join(long_off_stats, by = c(\"season2\" = \"season\", \"team\", \"metric\")) %>% \n    mutate(metric = factor(metric,\n                           levels = pull(off_stability, metric),\n                           labels = pull(off_stability, metric_label))) %>% \n    ggplot(aes(x = value.x, y = value.y)) +\n    geom_point(color = \"black\", alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"#ff2b4f\", se = FALSE) +\n   scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 5)) +\n   scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 5)) +\n   geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = \"grey\", size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +\n    facet_wrap(~metric, scales = \"free\") +\n    labs(x = \"\\nYear Y Metric\", \n         y = \"Year Y + 1 Metric\\n\",\n         title = \"Offense Stats - 2000-2019\",\n         subtitle = \"Linear model fit comparing Year and Year + 1\",\n         caption = \"Plot: @thomas_mock | Data: espnscrapeR\")  +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"black\"),\n          strip.text = element_textbox(face = \"bold\", color = \"white\")))\n\n# optional output\n# ggsave(\"off_stability_plot.png\", off_plot, height = 8, width = 10, dpi = 150)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

While this is not anywhere close to too much for R to handle, it can start to feel a little intimidating to read it all into memory. I’ll be covering some tooling to work with relatively larger datasets using the same dplyr tools you know and love!\nRead in the data\nBen and Sebastian were kind enough to provide all of the .RDS files for every year between 2000-2019 on GitHub for ease of download. With a quick purrr call we can download all 20 years of data and pull them into memory. We can also save them to local storage for offline access or to at least not need to re-download them down the line.\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nread_pbp_rds <- function(year){\n  readRDS(url(glue::glue('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guga31bb/nflfastR-data/master/data/play_by_play_{year}.rds')))\n}\n\nall_pbp <- 2000:2019 %>% \n  purrr::map_dfr(read_pbp_rds)\n  \nall_pbp %>% \n  write_rds(\"data/2000-2019_pbp_raw.rds\")\n\nHowever, as mentioned before this is ~ 2 GB of data in memory, which can take a while to download and/or read in especially if you do this multiple times as opposed to in just one session. Also - there are VERY few times where you actually need to pull in all of the specific columns and/or rows for your analysis, why waste time reading in data that you don’t need?\nEnter SQL\nNo no, I’m not going to make you learn SQL to work with this dataset, but we are going to use SQL inside R. Specifically, we’re going to play around with SQLite - in their own words:\n\nSQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. SQLite is the most used database engine in the world.\n\nWhat this provides for us is a super lightweight storage and query format that works nicely with R and dplyr. We don’t have to mess around with creating an entire database but rather have a small self-contained file that allows for many of the same SQL-features.\nFor a deeper dive on the RSQLite package, with basic and advanced usage check out the packagedown site. Additionally, the Data Carpentry guide is pretty similar to this guide but aimed at scientists.\nCreate the SQLite database\n\n\nlibrary(RSQLite)\nlibrary(DBI)\n\n# create the \"empty\" database\nmydb <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \"data/pbp_db.sqlite\")\nmydb\n\n\n\n# <SQLiteConnection>\n#   Path: /Users/thomasmock/nflscrapR/data/pbp_db.sqlite\n#   Extensions: TRUE\n\n\n\n# Write the in-memory data into the database as a table\nDBI::dbWriteTable(mydb, \"pbp_raw_2000-2019\", raw_pbp)\n\n# list the table\nDBI::dbListTables(mydb)\n\n\n\n# [1] \"pbp_raw_2000-2019\"\n\nOk - so to recap in about 2 lines of code we have created and populated a SQLite database solely through R. Now, the SQLite file is only around 1 GB compared to our 2 GB .RDS - so it’s more efficiently stored and allows us to do some other cool things as seen below.\ndbplyr\nNow the magic really happens: dplyr has a built-in package called dbplyr, this is a translation engine that lets you write dplyr code that is evaluated as SQL.\nFull details at the dbplyr site.\nThe basic concept is:\nConnect to a datasource/database\nQuery the database INSIDE the database or on disk\nPull the data into memory only when you’re ready\nOpen a connection\nWe can open the connection by calling tbl() on the database we have open (mydb) and indicating which table we want to query.\n\n\nlibrary(dbplyr)\n# Open a queryable connection with the database\npbp_db <- tbl(mydb, \"pbp_raw_2000-2019\")\n\npbp_db\n\n\n\n# Source:   table<pbp_raw_2000-2019> [?? x 291]\n# Database: sqlite 3.30.1 \n# [/Users/thomasmock/nflscrapR/data/pbp_db.sqlite]\n\n#   play_id game_id home_team away_team posteam posteam_type defteam side_of_field yardline_100\n#      <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>     <chr>     <chr>   <chr>        <chr>   <chr>                <dbl>\n#  1      34  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       NYG     home         ARI     NYG                     70\n#  2      70  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       ARI     away         NYG     NYG                     25\n#  3     106  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       ARI     away         NYG     ARI                     65\n#  4     131  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       ARI     away         NYG     ARI                     63\n#  5     148  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       ARI     away         NYG     ARI                     63\n#  6     165  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       ARI     away         NYG     ARI                     63\n#  7     190  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       NYG     home         ARI     NYG                     78\n#  8     211  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       NYG     home         ARI     NYG                     70\n#  9     232  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       NYG     home         ARI     NYG                     67\n# 10     253  2.00e9 NYG       ARI       NYG     home         ARI     NYG                     68\n# # … with more rows, and 282 more variables: game_date <dbl>, quarter_seconds_remaining <dbl>,\n# #   half_seconds_remaining <dbl>, game_seconds_remaining <dbl>, game_half <chr>,\n# #   quarter_end <dbl>, drive <dbl>, sp <dbl>, qtr <dbl>, down <chr>, goal_to_go <dbl>,\n# #   time <chr>, yrdln <chr>, ydstogo <dbl>, ydsnet <dbl>, desc <chr>, play_type <chr>,\n# #   yards_gained <dbl>, shotgun <dbl>, no_huddle <dbl>, qb_dropback <dbl>, qb_kneel <dbl>,\n# #   qb_spike <dbl>, qb_scramble <dbl>, pass_length <chr>, pass_location <chr>,\n# #   air_yards <dbl>, yards_after_catch <dbl>, run_location <chr>, run_gap <chr>,\n# #   field_goal_result <chr>, kick_distance <dbl>, extra_point_result <chr>,\n# #   two_point_conv_result <chr>, home_timeouts_remaining <dbl>,\n# #   away_timeouts_remaining <dbl>, timeout <dbl>, timeout_team <chr>, td_team <chr>,\n# #   posteam_timeouts_remaining <dbl>, defteam_timeouts_remaining <dbl>,\n# #   total_home_score <dbl>, total_away_score <dbl>, posteam_score <dbl>, defteam_score <dbl>,\n# #   score_differential <dbl>, posteam_score_post <dbl>, defteam_score_post <dbl>,\n# #   score_differential_post <dbl>, no_score_prob <dbl>, opp_fg_prob <dbl>,\n# #   opp_safety_prob <dbl>, opp_td_prob <dbl>, fg_prob <dbl>, safety_prob <dbl>,\n# #   td_prob <dbl>, extra_point_prob <dbl>, two_point_conversion_prob <dbl>, ep <dbl>,\n# #   epa <dbl>, total_home_epa <dbl>, total_away_epa <dbl>, total_home_rush_epa <dbl>,\n# #   total_away_rush_epa <dbl>, total_home_pass_epa <dbl>, total_away_pass_epa <dbl>,\n# #   air_epa <dbl>, yac_epa <dbl>, comp_air_epa <dbl>, comp_yac_epa <dbl>,\n# #   total_home_comp_air_epa <dbl>, total_away_comp_air_epa <dbl>,\n# #   total_home_comp_yac_epa <dbl>, total_away_comp_yac_epa <dbl>,\n# #   total_home_raw_air_epa <dbl>, total_away_raw_air_epa <dbl>, total_home_raw_yac_epa <dbl>,\n# #   total_away_raw_yac_epa <dbl>, wp <dbl>, def_wp <dbl>, home_wp <dbl>, away_wp <dbl>,\n# #   wpa <dbl>, home_wp_post <dbl>, away_wp_post <dbl>, total_home_rush_wpa <dbl>,\n# #   total_away_rush_wpa <dbl>, total_home_pass_wpa <dbl>, total_away_pass_wpa <dbl>,\n# #   air_wpa <dbl>, yac_wpa <dbl>, comp_air_wpa <dbl>, comp_yac_wpa <dbl>,\n# #   total_home_comp_air_wpa <dbl>, total_away_comp_air_wpa <dbl>,\n# #   total_home_comp_yac_wpa <dbl>, total_away_comp_yac_wpa <dbl>,\n# #   total_home_raw_air_wpa <dbl>, total_away_raw_air_wpa <dbl>, total_home_raw_yac_wpa <dbl>,\n# #   …\n\nBoom - 1 line of code and we now have a connection - also notice that the output has the following info at the top: > table<pbp_raw_2000-2019> [?? x 291]\nNotice that it has the right number of columns (291) but an unknown number of rows. This is because the data hasn’t been read into memory yet, and it has only returned the essentially the head() of the data. We don’t pull the data into memory until we call a new function - collect() this then pulls the data as it is at that point in the pipe into memory.\nQuery the database\nNow let’s do a basic query - we’ll time it to see how long this takes on all 263 million observations.\n\n\ntic()\npbp_db %>% \n  select(play_type, yards_gained, penalty, season) %>% \n  filter(play_type %in% c(\"run\", \"pass\"), penalty == 0) %>% \n  group_by(season, play_type) %>% \n  summarize(avg_yds = mean(yards_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n())\ntoc()\n\n\n\n# Source:   lazy query [?? x 4]\n# Database: sqlite 3.30.1 [/Users/thomasmock/nflscrapR/data/pbp_db.sqlite]\n# Groups:   season\n#    season play_type avg_yds     n\n#     <dbl> <chr>       <dbl> <int>\n#  1   2000 pass         5.84 17567\n#  2   2000 run          4.08 13682\n#  3   2001 pass         5.85 17264\n#  4   2001 run          4.04 13500\n#  5   2002 pass         5.85 18313\n#  6   2002 run          4.27 13746\n#  7   2003 pass         5.79 17322\n#  8   2003 run          4.24 14033\n#  9   2004 pass         6.12 17238\n# 10   2004 run          4.24 13828\n\n# 1.048 sec elapsed  \n\nSo we used our traditional dplyr code, it ran as SQL on the backend and took about 1 sec. Now, 1 sec is not THAT fast - and the same operation IN memory would be about 0.2 sec, but we save a lot of time on the read and can do lots of ad-hoc queries without pulling the data in. Also imagine a world where the data is much larger than memory, this same workflow would work on 100 GB of data or even petabytes of data with translation to spark via sparklyr for example.\nCollect the data\nLastly - we can also pull the data into memory, via collect(). This allows us to take the data and either continue to work with the summary or pass it to something like ggplot2.\n\n\ntic()\npbp_db %>% \n  select(play_type, yards_gained, penalty, season) %>% \n  filter(play_type %in% c(\"run\", \"pass\"), penalty == 0) %>% \n  group_by(season, play_type) %>% \n  summarize(avg_yds = mean(yards_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>% \n  collect() %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = season, y = avg_yds, color = play_type)) +\n  geom_line()\ntoc()\n\n\n\n# 1.451 sec elapsed  \n\n\nSo, in about 1.5 seconds we we’re able to query all of 2000-2019 and get a very basic ggplot. Cool!\nTLDR\nAltogether now skipping the additional info. You can see just how succintly you can use this method. It’s just like reading in other data formats!\n\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\npbp_db <- dplyr::tbl(DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), \"data/pbp_db.sqlite\"), \"pbp_raw_2000-2019\")\n\npbp_db %>% \n  select(play_type, yards_gained, penalty, season) %>% \n  filter(play_type %in% c(\"run\", \"pass\"), penalty == 0) %>% \n  group_by(season, play_type) %>% \n  summarize(avg_yds = mean(yards_gained, na.rm = TRUE),\n            n = n()) %>% \n  collect()\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 40 x 4\n# Groups:   season [20]\n#    season play_type avg_yds     n\n#     <dbl> <chr>       <dbl> <int>\n#  1   2000 pass         5.84 17567\n#  2   2000 run          4.08 13682\n#  3   2001 pass         5.85 17264\n#  4   2001 run          4.04 13500\n#  5   2002 pass         5.85 18313\n#  6   2002 run          4.27 13746\n#  7   2003 pass         5.79 17322\n#  8   2003 run          4.24 14033\n#  9   2004 pass         6.12 17238\n# 10   2004 run          4.24 13828\n# … with 30 more rows\n\nAdditional Notes\nI would be remiss to not mention alternative methods to getting relatively normal-sized data into memory. Using R is a great experience for small to medium sized datasets.\ndata.table::fread() is super fast for reading in files\ndata.table is also extremely fast when operating on in-memory data\nJust like with dplyr and dbplyr for reading from databases, dtplyr lets you use dplyr call to run data.table queries – I’ll cover this in a follow-up post\n\nvroom::vroom() is even faster for reading in data in some situations\nIn this case for our toy examples, pure dplyr, data.table and dtplyr are all essentially the same speed, about 0.1 - 0.2 seconds to run the same summary in-memory compared to ~ 1 sec via SQLite. However, the time-savings here are very much on read-in. \ndata.table::fread() takes about 28 seconds to read in the full csv, vroom::vroom() takes about 20 seconds to read in the full csv, and then either data.table or dplyr take between 0.1 - 0.2 seconds to perform the aggregation. This is compared to the ~ 1 second to aggregate with the same analysis via dbplyr + RSQLite. \n\n\ntic()\n\ndt_pbp <- fread(\"pbp_large.csv\")\n\ntoc()\n\n\n\n# |--------------------------------------------------|\n# |==================================================|\n# |--------------------------------------------------|\n# |==================================================|\n\n# 27.875 sec elapsed\n\nThe last thing I’ll add is that if you want to do additional modeling or work with the entire dataset over a long period of time, I think it makes sense to read it into memory to get the speed improvements of in-memory computation and access to the full range of R’s capability. Just wanted to bring up that it’s possible to rapidly work on relatively large datasets and only pull into memory when you are ready. \n\n\n",

We’ll use the 2011-2014 data for this example (84 total PDFs). For the purpose of today the files have already been downloaded, but I used the following script.\n\n\n# General function for download\ndownload_monthly_stats_pdf <- function(year){\n  \n  message(paste0(\"Downloading \", year))\n  \n  # The general format is yearmonth like 201101 for Jan 2011.\n  month_in <- c(\"01\", \"02\", \"03\", \"04\", \"05\", \"06\", \"07\", \"08\", \"09\", \"10\", \"11\", \"12\")\n  \n  year_vec <- rep(year, 12)\n  \n  url_build <- function(year_vec, month_in){\n      glue::glue(\"https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/statistics/{year}/{year}{month_in}beer.pdf\")\n  }\n  \n  # output to the pdfs folder\n  download_monthly_pdf <- function(year, month, url_in){\n    download.file(\n      url = url_in,\n      destfile = glue::glue(\"pdfs/ttb_monthly_stats_{year}-{month}.pdf\")\n      )\n  }\n  \n  # build all the input urls and attach to an input dataframe\n  full_df <- tibble(year = year_vec, month = month_in) %>% \n    mutate(url_in = pmap_chr(.l = list(year_vec, month_in), .f = url_build)) \n  \n  # The pwalk here takes all 3 inputs and applies them to download_monthly_pdf function\n  pwalk(full_df, .f = download_monthly_pdf)\n  \n}\n\nWe could apply that function to all the years of interest with another purrr::walk() call. This will run download_monthly_stats_pdf() for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\n\n\nwalk(c(2011:2014), download_monthly_stats_pdf)\n\nList File Names\n\n\n# list all the files we have downloaded so far\nall_files <- list.files(\"pdfs\")\n\nlength(all_files)\n\n[1] 48\n\nWe have 48 PDFs, as expected - 12 months x 4 years = 48!\nNow let’s take a peek inside one of the PDFs.\n\nRaw PDFs\nWhen we run pdftools::pdf_text() we can see a decently formatted table. The main issue to consider is that there is a lot erroneous header descriptions, and there are unequal spacing between “columns” in the table. Importantly, each line of the PDF is separated by a newline \\n.

vector we can start finding “rows” to drop. We can see that the 9th string is actually the column titles, and the table ends at the 36th string. However, this could change according to which PDF we are looking at, so rather than going by position we can use stringr::str_which() to match a logical with matched text.\n\n\n# Start of table - column names\nraw_text[9]\n\n[1] \"MANUFACTURE OF BEER                                      Current Month          Current Month      Year to Date        Year to Date\"\n\n# End of table - last value\nraw_text[36]\n\n[1] \"Total Used                                                   583,263,134             514,672,427     583,263,134          514,672,427\"\n\nWe get the same “rows” with our matching str_which().\n\n\n# find start of table\nstringr::str_which(raw_text, \"MANUFACTURE OF BEER\")\n\n[1] 9\n\n# find end of table\nstringr::str_which(raw_text, \"Total Used\")\n\n[1] 36\n\nLet’s actually assign this now, rather than just printing. We can also remove leading/trailing whitespace with stringr::str_trim(). When we look at table_trimmed we can “see” a group of text strings that much closer resemble a table!\n\n\ntable_start <- stringr::str_which(raw_text, \"MANUFACTURE OF BEER\")\n  \n# End of table (drop all the asterisks and the other descriptors)\ntable_end <- stringr::str_which(raw_text, \"Total Used\")\n  \n# Trim the table to the start/end and drop whitespace at each line\ntable_trimmed <- raw_text[table_start:table_end] %>% \n  str_trim()\n\ntable_trimmed\n\n [1] \"MANUFACTURE OF BEER                                      Current Month          Current Month      Year to Date        Year to Date\"   \n [2] \"Production                                                    14,981,472               15,012,331     14,981,472           15,012,331\" \n [3] \"Removals\"                                                                                                                              \n [4] \"Taxable ($7.00/$18.00 per barrel)\"                                                                                                     \n [5] \"In bottles and cans                                        11,571,819               11,908,922     11,571,819           11,908,922\"    \n [6] \"In barrels and kegs                                          1,245,125                1,245,143      1,245,125            1,245,143\"   \n [7] \"Tax Determined, Premises Use                                     5,989                    5,267          5,989                5,267\"   \n [8] \"Sub Total Taxable                                      12,822,933               13,159,332     12,822,933           13,159,332\"        \n [9] \"Tax-free\"                                                                                                                              \n[10] \"For export                                                     264,669                  224,066        264,669              224,066\"   \n[11] \"For vessels and aircraft                                             0                        0              0                    0\"   \n[12] \"Consumed on brewery premises                                       886                      913            886                  913\"   \n[13] \"Sub Total Tax-Free                                         265,555                  224,979        265,555              224,979\"       \n[14] \"Total Removals                                             13,088,488               13,384,311     13,088,488           13,384,311\"    \n[15] \"Stocks On Hand end-of-month:                                    9,896,961                9,993,268      9,896,961            9,993,268\"\n[16] \"MATERIALS USED AT BREWERIES\"                                                                                                           \n[17] \"Malt and malt products                                    322,480,722             330,304,432     322,480,722          330,304,432\"    \n[18] \"Corn and corn products                                     58,632,672               56,705,162     58,632,672           56,705,162\"    \n[19] \"Rice and rice products                                    108,112,318               59,701,345    108,112,318           59,701,345\"    \n[20] \"Barley and barley products                                   4,705,175                3,668,374      4,705,175            3,668,374\"   \n[21] \"Wheat and wheat products                                     1,210,137                1,409,685      1,210,137            1,409,685\"   \n[22] \"Total Grain products                                   495,141,024             451,788,998     495,141,024          451,788,998\"       \n[23] \"Sugar and syrups                                           73,793,509               47,308,358     73,793,509           47,308,358\"    \n[24] \"Hops (dry)                                                   6,059,066                4,765,924      6,059,066            4,765,924\"   \n[25] \"Hops (used as extracts)                                        296,605                  271,405        296,605              271,405\"   \n[26] \"Other                                                        7,972,930              10,537,742       7,972,930          10,537,742\"    \n[27] \"Total Non-Grain products                               88,122,110               62,883,429     88,122,110           62,883,429\"        \n[28] \"Total Used                                                   583,263,134             514,672,427     583,263,134          514,672,427\" \n\nRemove all the extra whitespace\nNext we need to remove all the huge whitespaces from between columns.

HOWEVER, for many many examples in the wild you will need to do additional data cleaning, data manipulation, factor assignment, etc. As such, I’ll continue working on this to get to a final output. I’ll also work on repeating this many times as opposed to one time.\nAlternative method via readr\nThanks to Grant McDermott for bringing up a good point here - I based this method off of tables where the white-space between columns is varying. If the white space is fixed between columns you could skip some steps as seen in the below example using readr::read_fwf(), courtesy of Grant. I believe for most cases either using readr::read_table() or readr::read_fwf() would be simple, but will keep the additional workflow steps in case they help someone down the road!\nOverall, using readr to natively parse the table-format could save the workflow step of trimming, coercing to a tibble, and then separating, and just requires you to indicate the spacing of empty cells either manually with fwf_widths() or guessing/parsing of columns via fwf_empty().\n\n\ntable_start_fwf <- stringr::str_which(raw_text, \"Production\") ## Changed since we're dropping the first row anyway\ntable_end_fwf <- stringr::str_which(raw_text, \"Total Used\")\n\n## Trim the table to the start/end (NB: Don't drop whitespace this time!)\ntable_trimmed_fwf <- raw_text[table_start_fwf:table_end_fwf]\n\nbeer_df_fwf <- read_fwf(table_trimmed_fwf, \n                        fwf_empty(table_trimmed_fwf, \n                                  col_names = c(\"type\", \n                                                \"month_current\", \n                                                \"month_prior_year\", \n                                                \"ytd_current\", \n                                                \"ytd_prior_year\")\n                                  )\n                        )\nbeer_df_fwf\n\n# A tibble: 27 x 5\n   type      month_current month_prior_year ytd_current ytd_prior_year\n   <chr>             <dbl>            <dbl>       <dbl>          <dbl>\n 1 Producti…      14981472         15012331    14981472       15012331\n 2 Removals             NA               NA          NA             NA\n 3 Taxable …            NA               NA          NA             NA\n 4 In bottl…      11571819         11908922    11571819       11908922\n 5 In barre…       1245125          1245143     1245125        1245143\n 6 Tax Dete…          5989             5267        5989           5267\n 7 Sub Tota…      12822933         13159332    12822933       13159332\n 8 Tax-free             NA               NA          NA             NA\n 9 For expo…        264669           224066      264669         224066\n10 For vess…             0                0           0              0\n# … with 17 more rows\n\nOne more alternative would be to just use readr::read_table() or readr::read_table2(). Now in practice this should be fairly robust, and works just fine for the examples here, but for messier tables it may fail which leads to the more complex and longer workflow shown below. Specifically, from the readr::read_table() docs:\n\nread_table() and read_table2() are designed to read the type of textual data where each column is separated by one (or more) > columns of space.\nread_table2() is like read.table(), it allows any number of whitespace characters between columns, and the lines can be of different lengths.\nread_table() is more strict, each line must be the same length, and each field is in the same position in every line. It first finds empty columns and then parses like a fixed width file.\n\n\n\nread_table(raw_text[table_start:table_end], skip =1,\n           col_names = c(\"type\", \"month_current\", \"month_prior_year\", \n                         \"ytd_current\", \"ytd_prior_year\"))\n\n# A tibble: 27 x 5\n   type      month_current month_prior_year ytd_current ytd_prior_year\n   <chr>             <dbl>            <dbl>       <dbl>          <dbl>\n 1 Producti…      14981472         15012331    14981472       15012331\n 2 Removals             NA               NA          NA             NA\n 3 Taxable …            NA               NA          NA             NA\n 4 In bottl…      11571819         11908922    11571819       11908922\n 5 In barre…       1245125          1245143     1245125        1245143\n 6 Tax Dete…          5989             5267        5989           5267\n 7 Sub Tota…      12822933         13159332    12822933       13159332\n 8 Tax-free             NA               NA          NA             NA\n 9 For expo…        264669           224066      264669         224066\n10 For vess…             0                0           0              0\n# … with 17 more rows\n\nProper Cleaning\nThis is actually two datasets that are combined into one large reporting table. As such we need to identify the specific row/point to split the dataset at. We can filter to just the row that matches either the string “MATERIALS USED” or “IN POUNDS”, as that indicates a label starting the 2nd dataset.\n\n\nslice_num <- beer_df %>% \n  # find a string that has MATERIALS USED or IN POUNDS\n  # | means OR\n    filter(str_detect(type, \"MATERIALS USED|IN POUNDS\")) %>%\n    pull(name)\n\nslice_num\n\n[1] 16\n\nSplit dataframe\nNext we will add a column based on logic for the slice_num, and assign a grouping variable for either Barrels Produced (dataset 1) or Pounds of Materials Used (dataset 2). We can then drop the unneeded rows with a filter(), group_by() the newly produced grouping variable, and use dplyr::group_split() to separate the combined dataset into a list of both datasets.\n\n\n# split data into materials vs barrels produced\nsplit_df <- beer_df %>% \n  mutate(data_type = ifelse(name >= slice_num, \"Pounds of Materials Used\", \"Barrels Produced\"),\n         type = str_remove(type, \":\")) %>% \n  select(data_type, everything(), -name) %>% \n  filter(!str_detect(type, \"IN POUNDS|MATERIALS USED|MANUFACTURE OF BEER|BARRELS\")) %>% \n  group_by(data_type) %>% \n  group_split()\n\nglimpse(split_df)\n\nlist<df[,8]> [1:2] \n$ : tibble [14 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n$ : tibble [12 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n@ ptype: tibble [0 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n\nFactor cleaning and final dataframes\nWe can see that the split_df object is a list of 2 tibbles/dataframes. We can now operate on the individual dataframes and finalize the factor cleaning and assignment to make the data a bit tidier and analysis ready.\n\n\nmanufacture_df <- split_df[[1]] %>% \n  mutate(\n    tax_status = case_when(\n      type %in% c(\"In bottles and cans\", \"In kegs\", \"In barrels and kegs\",\n                  \"Tax Determined, Premises Use\") ~ \"Taxable\",\n      type == \"Sub Total Taxable\" ~ \"Sub Total Taxable\",\n      type %in% c(\"For export\", \"For vessels and aircraft\", \n                  \"Consumed on brewery premises\") ~ \"Tax Free\",\n      type == \"Sub Total Tax-Free\" ~ \"Sub Total Tax-Free\",\n      type %in% c(\"Production\", \"Total Removals\", \n                  \"Stocks On Hand end-of-month:\") ~ \"Totals\"\n      ),\n    tax_rate = dplyr::if_else(year <= 2017, \"$7/$18 per barrel\", \"$3.50/$16 per barrel\")\n    ) %>% \n  filter(!is.na(tax_status)) %>% \n  select(data_type, tax_status, everything())\n\n\n\n# clean up the material dataset\nmaterial_df <- split_df[[2]] %>% \n  mutate(\n    material_type = case_when(\n      str_detect(type, \"Malt|Corn|Rice|Barley|Wheat\") ~ \"Grain Products\",\n      str_detect(type, \"Sugar|Hops|Other\") ~ \"Non-Grain Products\",\n      str_detect(type, \"Total\") ~ type\n    )\n  ) %>% \n  select(data_type, material_type, everything())\n\nPrint the dataframes\nThe manufacture dataframe now has the labels, factors, etc separated into nice columns, with the 4x columns for specific barrels produced.\n\n\nmanufacture_df\n\n# A tibble: 9 x 10\n  data_type tax_status  year month type  month_current\n  <chr>     <chr>      <int> <int> <chr>         <dbl>\n1 Barrels … Totals      2011     2 Prod…      14981472\n2 Barrels … Taxable     2011     2 In b…      11571819\n3 Barrels … Taxable     2011     2 In b…       1245125\n4 Barrels … Sub Total…  2011     2 Sub …      12822933\n5 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     2 For …        264669\n6 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     2 For …             0\n7 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     2 Cons…           886\n8 Barrels … Sub Total…  2011     2 Sub …        265555\n9 Barrels … Totals      2011     2 Tota…      13088488\n# … with 4 more variables: month_prior_year <dbl>, ytd_current <dbl>,\n#   ytd_prior_year <dbl>, tax_rate <chr>\n\nThe material dataframe now has the labels, factors, etc separated into nice columns, with the 4x columns for specific pounds of product used.\n\n\nmaterial_df\n\n# A tibble: 12 x 9\n   data_type material_type  year month type  month_current\n   <chr>     <chr>         <int> <int> <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Malt…     322480722\n 2 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Corn…      58632672\n 3 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Rice…     108112318\n 4 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Barl…       4705175\n 5 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Whea…       1210137\n 6 Pounds o… Total Grain …  2011     2 Tota…     495141024\n 7 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Suga…      73793509\n 8 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Hops…       6059066\n 9 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Hops…        296605\n10 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Other       7972930\n11 Pounds o… Total Non-Gr…  2011     2 Tota…      88122110\n12 Pounds o… Total Used     2011     2 Tota…     583263134\n# … with 3 more variables: month_prior_year <dbl>, ytd_current <dbl>,\n#   ytd_prior_year <dbl>\n\nFinished Cleaning\nWe have now finished cleaning the manufacting and material dataframes! However, we did this all line-by-line without functions and would need to repeat this for the other 47 PDFs! Let’s convert ALL that code into a function that outputs the final dataframes.\nUse a function\n\n\n# create a function that works for most years\nget_beer_tables <- function(year, month) {\n  \n  # read in the raw PDF\n  raw_text <- pdftools::pdf_text(glue::glue(\"pdfs/ttb_monthly_stats_{year}-{month}.pdf\")) %>%\n    str_split(\"\\n\") %>%\n    unlist()\n\n  ## Build Table\n\n  # find start of table\n  table_start <- stringr::str_which(raw_text, \"MANUFACTURE OF BEER\")\n\n  # End of table (drop all the asterisks and the other descriptors)\n  table_end <- stringr::str_which(raw_text, \"Total Used\")\n\n  # Trim the table to the start/end and drop whitespace at each line\n  table_trimmed <- raw_text[table_start:table_end] %>%\n    str_trim()\n\n  table_trimmed\n\n  ### Remove all the extra whitespace\n\n  # Replace long spaces with a col break symbol\n  squished_table <- str_replace_all(table_trimmed, \"\\\\s{2,}\", \"|\") %>%\n    str_remove_all(\",\")\n\n  ### Convert to tibble\n\n  # Convert to tibble\n  raw_df <- enframe(squished_table)\n  \n  # split the rows into their columns\n  beer_df <- suppressWarnings(raw_df %>%\n    separate(value,\n      into = c(\"type\", \"month_current\", \"month_prior_year\", \"ytd_current\", \"ytd_prior_year\"),\n      sep = \"\\\\|\"\n    ) %>%\n    slice(-1) %>%\n    mutate_at(vars(month_current:ytd_prior_year), as.double) %>%\n    mutate(year = as.integer(year), month = as.integer(month)) %>%\n    select(year, month, type, everything()))\n\n  ### Proper Cleaning\n\n  # ID the specific row/point to split the dataset at.\n\n  slice_num <- beer_df %>%\n    # find a string that has MATERIALS USED or IN POUNDS\n    # | means OR\n    filter(str_detect(type, \"MATERIALS USED|IN POUNDS\")) %>%\n    pull(name)\n\n  #### Split dataframe\n\n  # split data into materials vs barrels produced\n  split_df <- suppressWarnings(beer_df %>%\n    mutate(\n      data_type = ifelse(name >= slice_num, \"Pounds of Materials Used\", \"Barrels Produced\"),\n      type = str_remove(type, \":\")\n    ) %>%\n    select(data_type, everything(), -name) %>%\n    filter(!str_detect(type, \"IN POUNDS|MATERIALS USED|MANUFACTURE OF BEER|BARRELS\")) %>%\n    group_by(data_type) %>%\n    group_split())\n\n  #### Factor cleaning and final dataframes\n\n  # clean manufacture df\n  manufacture_df <- split_df[[1]] %>%\n    mutate(\n      tax_status = case_when(\n        type %in% c(\n          \"In bottles and cans\", \"In kegs\", \"In barrels and kegs\",\n          \"Tax Determined, Premises Use\"\n        ) ~ \"Taxable\",\n        type == \"Sub Total Taxable\" ~ \"Sub Total Taxable\",\n        type %in% c(\n          \"For export\", \"For vessels and aircraft\",\n          \"Consumed on brewery premises\"\n        ) ~ \"Tax Free\",\n        type == \"Sub Total Tax-Free\" ~ \"Sub Total Tax-Free\",\n        type %in% c(\n          \"Production\", \"Total Removals\",\n          \"Stocks On Hand end-of-month:\"\n        ) ~ \"Totals\"\n      ),\n      tax_rate = dplyr::if_else(year <= 2017, \"$7/$18 per barrel\", \"$3.50/$16 per barrel\")\n    ) %>%\n    filter(!is.na(tax_status)) %>%\n    select(data_type, tax_status, everything())\n\n  # clean up the material dataset\n  material_df <- split_df[[2]] %>%\n    mutate(\n      material_type = case_when(\n        str_detect(type, \"Malt|Corn|Rice|Barley|Wheat\") ~ \"Grain Products\",\n        str_detect(type, \"Sugar|Hops|Other\") ~ \"Non-Grain Products\",\n        str_detect(type, \"Total\") ~ type\n      )\n    ) %>%\n    select(data_type, material_type, everything())\n\n  # output a list of both dfs\n  list(manufacture_df, material_df)\n}\n\nReally the only code we have changed is we added a glue call to add the year, month to which PDF to read in, and we have the output as a list of both dataframes. Let’s test our function!\n\n\nget_beer_tables(2011, \"01\")\n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 9 x 10\n  data_type tax_status  year month type  month_current\n  <chr>     <chr>      <int> <int> <chr>         <dbl>\n1 Barrels … Totals      2011     1 Prod…      14981472\n2 Barrels … Taxable     2011     1 In b…      11571819\n3 Barrels … Taxable     2011     1 In b…       1245125\n4 Barrels … Sub Total…  2011     1 Sub …      12822933\n5 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     1 For …        264669\n6 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     1 For …             0\n7 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     1 Cons…           886\n8 Barrels … Sub Total…  2011     1 Sub …        265555\n9 Barrels … Totals      2011     1 Tota…      13088488\n# … with 4 more variables: month_prior_year <dbl>, ytd_current <dbl>,\n#   ytd_prior_year <dbl>, tax_rate <chr>\n\n[[2]]\n# A tibble: 12 x 9\n   data_type material_type  year month type  month_current\n   <chr>     <chr>         <int> <int> <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     1 Malt…     322480722\n 2 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     1 Corn…      58632672\n 3 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     1 Rice…     108112318\n 4 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     1 Barl…       4705175\n 5 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     1 Whea…       1210137\n 6 Pounds o… Total Grain …  2011     1 Tota…     495141024\n 7 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     1 Suga…      73793509\n 8 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     1 Hops…       6059066\n 9 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     1 Hops…        296605\n10 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     1 Other       7972930\n11 Pounds o… Total Non-Gr…  2011     1 Tota…      88122110\n12 Pounds o… Total Used     2011     1 Tota…     583263134\n# … with 3 more variables: month_prior_year <dbl>, ytd_current <dbl>,\n#   ytd_prior_year <dbl>\n\nBoom! Function is working for our example, let’s try it out with more than 1 input via purrr!\npurrr - iteration without repetition\nWe’ll be using pmap() to apply our function multiple times, where pmap can take any number of inputs. For example if we call get_beer_tables() via pmap, we can get our tables for that 1 year/month combo!\n\n\n# Quick test of purrr\npmap(list(2011, \"02\"), get_beer_tables)\n\n[[1]]\n[[1]][[1]]\n# A tibble: 9 x 10\n  data_type tax_status  year month type  month_current\n  <chr>     <chr>      <int> <int> <chr>         <dbl>\n1 Barrels … Totals      2011     2 Prod…      14350832\n2 Barrels … Taxable     2011     2 In b…      11509264\n3 Barrels … Taxable     2011     2 In b…       1234147\n4 Barrels … Sub Total…  2011     2 Sub …      12749447\n5 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     2 For …        279150\n6 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     2 For …             0\n7 Barrels … Tax Free    2011     2 Cons…           942\n8 Barrels … Sub Total…  2011     2 Sub …        280092\n9 Barrels … Totals      2011     2 Tota…      13029539\n# … with 4 more variables: month_prior_year <dbl>, ytd_current <dbl>,\n#   ytd_prior_year <dbl>, tax_rate <chr>\n\n[[1]][[2]]\n# A tibble: 12 x 9\n   data_type material_type  year month type  month_current\n   <chr>     <chr>         <int> <int> <chr>         <dbl>\n 1 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Malt…     307076591\n 2 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Corn…      53981943\n 3 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Rice…      54287863\n 4 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Barl…       4322047\n 5 Pounds o… Grain Produc…  2011     2 Whea…        955671\n 6 Pounds o… Total Grain …  2011     2 Tota…     420624115\n 7 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Suga…      63374850\n 8 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Hops…       7617974\n 9 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Hops…        275963\n10 Pounds o… Non-Grain Pr…  2011     2 Other       7997916\n11 Pounds o… Total Non-Gr…  2011     2 Tota…      79266703\n12 Pounds o… Total Used     2011     2 Tota…     499890818\n# … with 3 more variables: month_prior_year <dbl>, ytd_current <dbl>,\n#   ytd_prior_year <dbl>\n\nHowever our goal is all the inputs at once! We can create a vector of the month inputs as character strings, and then use tidyr::crossing() to output all the possible combinations of year + month as a dataframe.

Running this takes only about 2 seconds across the 48 PDFs! The output is not very exciting as the data is simply the year & month columns, plus a list-column called data. Let’s get the final outputs!\n\n\n# add the month_num as vector\nmonth_num <- c(\"01\", \"02\", \"03\", \"04\", \"05\", \"06\", \"07\", \"08\", \"09\", \"10\", \"11\", \"12\")\n\n# use crossing to generate all combos for the data \ndf_2011_2014 <- crossing(year = c(2011:2014), \n                         month = month_num) %>% \n  mutate(data = pmap(., get_beer_tables))\n\ndf_2011_2014\n\n# A tibble: 48 x 3\n    year month data      \n   <int> <chr> <list>    \n 1  2011 01    <list [2]>\n 2  2011 02    <list [2]>\n 3  2011 03    <list [2]>\n 4  2011 04    <list [2]>\n 5  2011 05    <list [2]>\n 6  2011 06    <list [2]>\n 7  2011 07    <list [2]>\n 8  2011 08    <list [2]>\n 9  2011 09    <list [2]>\n10  2011 10    <list [2]>\n# … with 38 more rows\n\nFinal output\nWe can now get just the output data, drop the other columns. We’re still working with list-columns, so let’s get to the manufacture_df and material_df.\n\n\nfinal_output <- df_2011_2014 %>%\n  # grab the data into respective columns\n  mutate(manufacture_data = map(data, 1),\n         material_data = map(data, 2)) %>% \n  select(manufacture_data, material_data)\n\nfinal_output\n\n# A tibble: 48 x 2\n   manufacture_data  material_data    \n   <list>            <list>           \n 1 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 2 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 3 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 4 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 5 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 6 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 7 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 8 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n 9 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n10 <tibble [9 × 10]> <tibble [12 × 9]>\n# … with 38 more rows\n\nThe manufacture dataframe can be combined as below.\n\n\n# Grab just the manufacture data\nmanufacture_df <- final_output %>% \n  select(manufacture_data) %>% \n  unnest(manufacture_data)\n\n# Grab just the manufacture data\nmaterial_df <- final_output %>% \n  select(material_data) %>% \n  unnest(material_data)\n\nAnd now we can look at the outputs!\nManufacture dataset\n\n\nglimpse(manufacture_df)\n\nRows: 432\nColumns: 10\n$ data_type        <chr> \"Barrels Produced\", \"Barrels Produced\", \"B…\n$ tax_status       <chr> \"Totals\", \"Taxable\", \"Taxable\", \"Sub Total…\n$ year             <int> 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, …\n$ month            <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, …\n$ type             <chr> \"Production\", \"In bottles and cans\", \"In b…\n$ month_current    <dbl> 14981472, 11571819, 1245125, 12822933, 264…\n$ month_prior_year <dbl> 15012331, 11908922, 1245143, 13159332, 224…\n$ ytd_current      <dbl> 14981472, 11571819, 1245125, 12822933, 264…\n$ ytd_prior_year   <dbl> 15012331, 11908922, 1245143, 13159332, 224…\n$ tax_rate         <chr> \"$7/$18 per barrel\", \"$7/$18 per barrel\", …\n\nMaterial dataset\n\n\nglimpse(material_df)\n\nRows: 576\nColumns: 9\n$ data_type        <chr> \"Pounds of Materials Used\", \"Pounds of Mat…\n$ material_type    <chr> \"Grain Products\", \"Grain Products\", \"Grain…\n$ year             <int> 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, 2011, …\n$ month            <int> 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, …\n$ type             <chr> \"Malt and malt products\", \"Corn and corn p…\n$ month_current    <dbl> 322480722, 58632672, 108112318, 4705175, 1…\n$ month_prior_year <dbl> 330304432, 56705162, 59701345, 3668374, 14…\n$ ytd_current      <dbl> 322480722, 58632672, 108112318, 4705175, 1…\n$ ytd_prior_year   <dbl> 330304432, 56705162, 59701345, 3668374, 14…\n\nDo it all in 6 Lines of Code!\nNow all of that could have been done in about 6 lines of tidyverse code since we created a function.\n\n\n# Use crossing to generate all 48 combos for the data \n# Use purrr to read in, clean, and output the 96 tables from the 48 PDFs\nfinal_output <- crossing(year = c(2011:2014), month = month_num) %>% \n  mutate(data = pmap(., get_beer_tables)) %>% \n  mutate(manufacture_data = map(data, 1), material_data = map(data, 2)) %>% \n  select(manufacture_data, material_data)\n\n# Grab just the manufacture data\nmanufacture_df <- final_output %>% select(manufacture_data) %>% unnest(manufacture_data)\n\n# Grab just the manufacture data\nmaterial_df <- final_output %>% select(material_data) %>% unnest(material_data)\n\n\n\n",

The family of games also includes Ten Grand, Farkle, Zilch, and others according to Wikipedia - with the common thread being that you have 5-6 dice, roll them, and add up scoring dice until you stop with a set score or “zippy”, which is a roll with zero scoring die.\nBasic gist: - Roll 5 dice - If you “score” with at least one die, you can stay or keep rolling - If you roll zero scoring die, you lose your turn\nA basic scoring table can be seen below.\n\nhtml {\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Fira Sans',

score)\n    \n\nWe played 10,000 on New Year’s Day, and we had a disagreement about if you have 2/5 scoring die whether to roll 3 or 4.\nI’ve literally never done probability math EVER… but I felt that it was more effective to roll 4 than 3.\nSo I attempted to simulate rolls in #rstats!\nSimulating 10,000 rolls\nSo we need to create a dataset of possible rolls, and how common these are when randomly created. We’ll set a seed so that we can reproduce the code, and for puns sake we’ll roll the dice 10,000 times to match our game’s title.\nImportantly, we also will be breaking this down into 5x 10,000 samples which is: - Rolling 1 dice all the way to rolling 5 dice (max possible).\nGenerating this is fairly straightforward using tidyr::crossing() and purrr::map() + sample().\nCrossing\ntidyr::crossing() takes multiple vectors and creates a tibble of all the possible combinations. Thus we can use it to generate the number of dice in hand along with our 10,000 simulations per number of dice in hand. Our toy example below shows the expected behavior, and then we’ll assign the rolls to a stored dataframe.\n\n\n# Toy example\n# 1 to 5 dice in hand x 5 trials/per dice group = 25 observations\ncrossing(dice_in_hand = seq(1, 5, 1),\n                       trial = 1:5)\n\n# A tibble: 25 x 2\n   dice_in_hand trial\n          <dbl> <int>\n 1            1     1\n 2            1     2\n 3            1     3\n 4            1     4\n 5            1     5\n 6            2     1\n 7            2     2\n 8            2     3\n 9            2     4\n10            2     5\n# … with 15 more rows\n\nFor, the actual dataframe we’ll do an additional step, which is creating a vector of rolls with random sampling based on how many dice are in hand. For our 1:5 dice in hand + 10,000 samples per dice in hand we get 50,000 simulations.\n\n\nset.seed(37)\nn_rolls <- 10000\n\n# Generate a sample of rolls (10000 sims)\ndice_rolls <- crossing(dice_in_hand = seq(1, 5, 1),\n                       trial = 1:n_rolls) %>%\n  mutate(roll = map(dice_in_hand, ~ sample(1:6, ., replace = TRUE)))\n\ndice_rolls\n\n# A tibble: 50,000 x 3\n   dice_in_hand trial roll     \n          <dbl> <int> <list>   \n 1            1     1 <int [1]>\n 2            1     2 <int [1]>\n 3            1     3 <int [1]>\n 4            1     4 <int [1]>\n 5            1     5 <int [1]>\n 6            1     6 <int [1]>\n 7            1     7 <int [1]>\n 8            1     8 <int [1]>\n 9            1     9 <int [1]>\n10            1    10 <int [1]>\n# … with 49,990 more rows\n\nCheck rolls\nWe can take a look at a few of these simulations. In this case, I’ll grab a random trial and see what we got for each of the dice in hand (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5).\n\n\ndice_rolls %>% \n  filter(trial == 3737) %>% \n  pull(roll)\n\n[[1]]\n[1] 3\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 2 1\n\n[[3]]\n[1] 3 3 3\n\n[[4]]\n[1] 6 5 2 3\n\n[[5]]\n[1] 4 1 6 5 3\n\nNow that we have a sense of our 10,000 simulations and our possible outcomes we need to generate some logic for scoring! We could simply count observations, but that won’t tell us the whole story.\nCounting & Scoring functions\nI tried this several ways but ended up sticking with vectors. The goal was to have programmatic logic to convert raw dice rolls like 1, 1, 3, 4, 1 to 1,000 (3x 1 = 1,000, 3 and 4 do not score).\nStep 1: Convert raw rolls to counts\nWe need to take the raw rolls (1, 1, 3, 4, 1) to counts of each number. I created a counting function which now tells us how many of each possible dice side (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) there are.\n\n\ncounting_function <- function(dice_in){\n  x1 <- sum(dice_in == 1)\n  x2 <- sum(dice_in == 2)\n  x3 <- sum(dice_in == 3)\n  x4 <- sum(dice_in == 4)\n  x5 <- sum(dice_in == 5)\n  x6 <- sum(dice_in == 6)\n  \n  roll_vec <- c(x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6)\n  roll_vec\n}\n\nA test example can be seen below. The output can be read as One 1, One 2, Three 3, Zero 4, Zero 5, and Zero 6. We can then feed this into our downstream functions to get scoring.\n\n\ncounting_function(c(1, 2, 3, 3, 3))\n\n[1] 1 1 3 0 0 0\n\nStep 2: Scoring Function\n\n\n\nThere are actually many steps to this, but the bulk of it is just logical matching potential outcomes to observations. Each type of scoring (number of ones, number of fives, short straights, triples, quadruplpes, and quintuples) has it’s own check, and then I add the scoring at the end based on the various combos/inputs. Using the same input as our previous example, we should get a total score of 400, which is One 1 at 100 points, and Three 3s at 100 * face value (100 x 3).\n\n\ncounting_function(c(1, 2, 3, 3, 3)) %>% \n  rigid_scoring_function()\n\n[1] 400\n\nLet’s do a few more checks for sanity. A short straight (1:5) should get you 1000, and then let’s try for a zero score with no scoring die.\n\n\n# should be 1000\ncounting_function(c(5, 1, 3, 4, 2)) %>% \n  rigid_scoring_function()\n\n[1] 1000\n\n# zero\ncounting_function(c(2, 2, 4, 4, 6)) %>% \n  rigid_scoring_function()\n\n[1] 0\n\nThe actual logic can be seen below.\n\n\n# TOO much logic to get actual scores\nrigid_scoring_function <- function(dice_in){\n  \n  dice_side <- c(1:6)\n  \n  n_of_ones <- sum(dice_in[1])\n  \n  n_of_fives <- sum(dice_in[5])\n  \n  straight_one <- c(1,1,1,1,1,0)\n  straight_two <- c(0,1,1,1,1,1)\n  \n  straight <- any(all(dice_in == straight_two), all(dice_in == straight_one))\n  \n  score_fives <- if_else(n_of_fives <= 2 & straight == FALSE,\n                         (n_of_fives * 50),\n                         0\n  )\n  \n  score_ones <- case_when(\n    n_of_ones <= 2 & straight == FALSE ~ (n_of_ones * 100),\n    n_of_ones == 3 ~ 1000,\n    n_of_ones == 4 ~ 5000,\n    n_of_ones == 5 ~ 10000,\n    TRUE ~ 0\n  )\n  \n  three_or_more <- sum(dice_in >= 3)\n  \n  three_or_more_subset <- dice_in >= 3\n  \n  multiply_dups <- case_when(\n    sum(dice_in == 3) == 1 & n_of_ones < 3 ~ 1L,\n    sum(dice_in == 4) == 1 & n_of_ones < 3 ~ 2L,\n    sum(dice_in == 5) == 1 & n_of_ones < 3 ~ 3L,\n    TRUE ~ 0L\n  )\n  \n  multi_score <- ifelse(three_or_more == TRUE, \n                        dice_side[three_or_more_subset], \n                        0) * 100 * multiply_dups\n  \n  \n  straight_score <- if_else(straight == TRUE, 1000, 0)\n  \n  three_or_more <- any(dice_in >= 3)\n  \n  total_score <- sum(score_ones + multi_score + straight_score + score_fives, na.rm = TRUE)\n  total_score\n  \n}\n\nGet scoring from the sample\nGenerating the scores is actually extremely simple now, the hard part was defining the logic above!\nWe use purrr::map() to generate a vector of the rolls using our counting_function(), and then get a score using purrr::map_dbl() to call our rigid_scoring_function() on each vector input of the die rolls! This will take about 15 seconds for calculating scores across the 50,000 total observations.\n\n\n# Generate the actual scoring from existing sample\ndice_df <- dice_rolls %>% \n  mutate(dice_vector = map(roll, counting_function),\n         rigid_scoring = map_dbl(dice_vector, rigid_scoring_function))\n\n# sanity check the scoring to get a few different scores\ndice_df %>% \n  select(dice_in_hand, rigid_scoring) %>% \n  sample_n(10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 x 2\n   dice_in_hand rigid_scoring\n          <dbl>         <dbl>\n 1            2             0\n 2            4            50\n 3            4           200\n 4            5           200\n 5            5          1000\n 6            5           150\n 7            4             0\n 8            5           250\n 9            3            50\n10            4           200\n\nPlotting\nNow that we have the outcome scoring, we can see how the probabilities stack up! Our thesis was that rolling 4x die was more likely to get you both a better score AND less likely to zippy out or get zero. We can see that rolling 4x die vs 3x die is about half as likely to get zero (15% vs 30%) and 2-3x more likely to get good scores (300 to 1,000).\nSuccess! If you roll 5 die, get 2 scoring die, it makes sense to only keep 1 of those scoring dice and and roll the other 4!\nPlease note that I chose a specific set of scores (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 1000) - as they are possible to get with either 3 or 4 die. There are scores in between 600 - 1000 that can only be achieved with 4 - 5 die in hand so it didn’t make sense to plot them against 3 die.\n\n\n# Quick plot\nprob_plot <- dice_df %>% \n

(Bird not included)\nThe function details\n\n\n\n\n\nvia GIPHY\n\nIf you missed out on Portlandia, you should take some time to watch this clip of the “Put a bird on it” episode.\n\n\nJust like Bryce and Lisa - we can put birds on anything with the magick package from ROpenSci!\nSo let’s get started putting birds on things!\nMagic with magick!\nThe magick package is an R interface to the ImageMagick STL, one of the most comprehensive open source image processing libraries. It gives a lot of power to R users, and we’ll briefly cover the workflow before getting into our real example.\nIf you want a deeper dive on all the features of magick, check out their awesome vignette!\n\n\n# Load the library\nlibrary(magick)\n\n# \"read\" in an image\ndog <- image_read(\"https://images.pexels.com/photos/1564506/pexels-photo-1564506.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&h=650&w=940\")\n\nimage_info(dog)\n\n  format width height colorspace matte filesize density\n1   JPEG  1880   1208       sRGB FALSE    87114   72x72\n\nWe can see a few things about the r_logo object, it is a .png, it’s height and width, filesize, and DPI/density.\nWe can also view the image in line.\n\n\nprint(dog)\n\n  format width height colorspace matte filesize density\n1   JPEG  1880   1208       sRGB FALSE    87114   72x72\n\n\nWe also have image manipulation options like image_rotate, image_resize, all of which are pipeable with the %>%.\n\n\ndog %>% \n  image_rotate(30) %>% # rotate 30 degrees\n  image_resize(\"400x400\") %>%  # change size to 400 x 400 pixels\n  image_flop() # flip the image horizontally\n\n\nMost importantly we can put a bird on it!\n\n\nbird <- image_read(\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29187501/38769895-edae85d0-3fcf-11e8-95f9-bbd530b32771.png\") %>% \n  image_resize(\"150x150\")\n\nimage_composite(dog, bird)\n\n\nNow please note where the bird showed up, in the top left corner. We can control the placement of composite images by specifying the offset.\n\n\ndog %>% \n  image_composite(bird, offset = \"+500+1000\")\n\n\nNotice that offset reads as x-axis pixels, y-axis pixels, so \"+500+1000 indicates from the top left corner place the image 500 pixels to the right and 1000 pixels down.\nNow that we’ve been oriented to how the magick package works, and had some fun by putting a bird on our lovely Boston Terrier model, let’s dive into the real purpose of this post - adding a logo to your ggplot!\nBuilding a ggplot with a logo\nIn the exampe I will show below you will have already saved the plot as an image, so we can skip with the normal ggplot2 code. However, please note that if you do want to build in some extra whitespace to your plot to save “space” for your logo you can do so by changing the margins of your overall plot. You can also add a figure caption with labs(caption = \"text to change here\"), which inherently adds some whitespace to incorporate the caption.\nMargins can take multiple units arguments including: “cm”, “in”, “lines”, “pt”, for more info check out the ggplot2 docs.\nNotice: The margins read as t, r, b, l or c(top, right, bottom, left). I typically see logos on the bottom left or top right so you can:\nadd space at the top for example with:c(2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5)\nadd space to the bottom with:c(0.5, 0.5, 2.5, 0.5)\nNotice the below plot has extra space on the bottom, and I have added a grey background purely to highlight this extra space.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nmtcars %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = cyl, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(0.5, 0.5, 2.5, 0.5), \"lines\"),\n        plot.background = element_rect(\"lightgrey\"))\n\n\n# plot background = lightgrey for highlight, not necessary for sizing\n\nRead in a plot\nSo let’s read in our publication plot to work with! Please notice that this can be a local file with traditional path structure or a hosted image as a url. I’m using URLs so you can try these out yourself!\n\n\npub_plot <- image_read(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jthomasmock/tomtom/master/vignettes/basic_plot.png\")\n\nlogo <- image_read(\"https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/RStudio-Logo-Flat.png\") %>% \n  image_resize(300)\n\nprint(pub_plot)\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 7\n  format width height colorspace matte filesize density\n  <chr>  <int>  <int> <chr>      <lgl>    <int> <chr>  \n1 PNG     2222   1951 sRGB       TRUE    168897 72x72  \n\n\nprint(logo)\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 7\n  format width height colorspace matte filesize density\n  <chr>  <int>  <int> <chr>      <lgl>    <int> <chr>  \n1 PNG      300    105 sRGB       TRUE         0 57x57  \n\n\nWhere to put the logo?\nWe can then overlay the logo over the plot, let’s try bottom left, and we want ~ 1% padding for aesthetics - so we can use the following code to get dimensions and pixel numbers.\n\n\n# get dims of the plot\nplot_height <- magick::image_info(pub_plot)$height\nplot_width <- magick::image_info(pub_plot)$width\n\n# get dims of the logo\nlogo_width <- magick::image_info(logo)$width\nlogo_height <- magick::image_info(logo)$height\n\n# get number of pixels to be 1% from the bottom of the plot\n# while accounting for the logo height\nplot_height - logo_height - plot_height * 0.01\n\n[1] 1826.49\n\n# get number of pixels to be 1% from the left of the plot\nplot_width * 0.01\n\n[1] 22.22\n\nAdd the logo\nBy using offset = \"+22+1826\" we indicate that we are placing the logo 22 pixels to the right and 1826 pixels down.\n\n\npub_plot %>% \n  image_composite(logo, offset = \"+22+1826\")\n\n\nBoom! We have our logo overlay on the plot in the right location! But we had to manually figure out and set the logo position, which is less than ideal for programmatic use down the road. I also manually resized the logo to 300 pixels in an earlier step - we should make that automagick as well!\nPut it in a function! (Bird not included)\nTo make the logo add process more reproducible, we can build a function to take the various heights and widths of the logo/plot and automatically resize the logo to match as well as calculating the number of pixels to put it in each respective corner. The logo_scale argument defaults to 10 - so the logo will be 1/10th the width of the plot.\n\n\nplot_with_logo <- add_logo(\n  plot_path = \"\", # url or local file for the plot\n  logo_path = \"\", # url or local file for the logo\n  logo_position = \"\" # choose a corner\n  # 'top left', 'top right', 'bottom left' or 'bottom right'\n  #logo_scale = 10 as default, but can change to manually make logo bigger\n)\n\n# save the image and write to working directory\nmagick::image_write(plot_with_logo, \"plot_with_logo.png\")\n\nThe function details\nThis function takes in two images, gets the dimension information, then pastes the logo at 1/10th scale in the specified corner with 1% padding. The function also has a warning if you input a logo_position that is not included.\n\n\nadd_logo <- function(plot_path, logo_path, logo_position, logo_scale = 10){\n\n    # Requires magick R Package https://github.com/ropensci/magick\n\n    # Useful error message for logo position\n    if (!logo_position %in% c(\"top right\", \"top left\", \"bottom right\", \"bottom left\")) {\n        stop(\"Error Message: Uh oh! Logo Position not recognized\\n  Try: logo_positon = 'top left', 'top right', 'bottom left', or 'bottom right'\")\n    }\n\n    # read in raw images\n    plot <- magick::image_read(plot_path)\n    logo_raw <- magick::image_read(logo_path)\n\n    # get dimensions of plot for scaling\n    plot_height <- magick::image_info(plot)$height\n    plot_width <- magick::image_info(plot)$width\n\n    # default scale to 1/10th width of plot\n    # Can change with logo_scale\n    logo <- magick::image_scale(logo_raw, as.character(plot_width/logo_scale))\n\n    # Get width of logo\n    logo_width <- magick::image_info(logo)$width\n    logo_height <- magick::image_info(logo)$height\n\n    # Set position of logo\n    # Position starts at 0,0 at top left\n    # Using 0.01 for 1% - aesthetic padding\n\n    if (logo_position == \"top right\") {\n        x_pos = plot_width - logo_width - 0.01 * plot_width\n        y_pos = 0.01 * plot_height\n    } else if (logo_position == \"top left\") {\n        x_pos = 0.01 * plot_width\n        y_pos = 0.01 * plot_height\n    } else if (logo_position == \"bottom right\") {\n        x_pos = plot_width - logo_width - 0.01 * plot_width\n        y_pos = plot_height - logo_height - 0.01 * plot_height\n    } else if (logo_position == \"bottom left\") {\n        x_pos = 0.01 * plot_width\n        y_pos = plot_height - logo_height - 0.01 * plot_height\n    }\n\n    # Compose the actual overlay\n    magick::image_composite(plot, logo, offset = paste0(\"+\", x_pos, \"+\", y_pos))\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nSo there you go! Happy logo adding and bird putting!\nFor more information on adding logos to plots with magick::image_append() instead, check out this blog post by Daniel Hadley on using magick::image_append to add a logo or his RStudioConf talk on the same idea.\nCheers!\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\n\nOne of my #rstats goals for 2019 was to make #TidyTuesday better, both from the experience on GitHub and the weekly posting for myself and for others.\nThe first thing I did for the project was to re-organize the GitHub repo, moving all the 2018 data into an archived folder and making a new 2019 folder to begin populating with new data! Additionally, with some help from Philip Khor via a pull-request - the GitHub repo is now full of relative (rather than absolute) paths to make life easier for anyone that forks the repo.\nI reorganized the Useful Links section at the bottom of the repo to make it more succinct, adding a few more links including Happy Git with R by Jenny Bryan! If you are just getting started with GitHub and want to learn more about Git, GitHub, and using it from within RStudio - check out her resources!\nWays to contribute\nI’m always on the lookout for interesting datasets, and a way for you to contribute to TidyTuesday beyond a weekly post is submitting a dataset you find in the wild as an Issue on the TidyTuesday repo. Please link to the dataset and add any additional info as to why you thought it was interesting or an article/plot that corresponds to that data.\nI added the Submitting Code Chunks section directly to the readme doc. This is for some code, script, etc that you found useful when working with TidyTuesday. It’s also a chance for a low-stress pull-request as that’s how we will be adding code chunks! Please see the guide here about the format to submit.\nImproving my Weekly Tweet Submission Process\nI generally switched between a lot of tabs, eg GitHub, short links, manually adding pics, etc while getting the weekly post setup. I knew there was a way to at least partially automate this, so I looked into my options.\nThe rtweet package has a post to Twitter function via rtweet::post_tweet() which allows you to programmatically post tweets! However - to get where I wanted to be I had to add a few more things and do some interesting refactoring!\nDISCLAIMER\nTo use rtweet for posting you will need to register a Twitter application - please see Mike Kearney’s great vignette on how to do this.\n\n\n# Basic method of tweeting from rtweet vignette\n\npost_tweet(status = \"my first rtweet #rstats\", media = NULL,\n  token = NULL, in_reply_to_status_id = NULL, destroy_id = NULL,\n  retweet_id = NULL)\n\nMy Weekly #TidyTuesday Tweet\nIf I simply wanted to post a tweet following the format for #TidyTuesday I could do something like the following.\n\n\nrtweet::post_tweet(\"The @r4dscommunity welcomes you to Week 2 of #TidyTuesday! We're exploring data about *esoteric topic*!\n                   Data: link_to_data\n                   Article: link_to_article\",\n                   media = \"tt_logo.png\")\n\nHowever this results in the following Tweet:\n\nThis is not exactly what I want… the text isn’t aligned properly, I want more than 1 pic, and I really would prefer to use emoji to save characters over Data: and Article:.\nSo on to the next step!\nHadley Wickham has the emo package which allows you to input various emoji into R/R Markdown. This package perfectly solves our emoji needs! I can use code like emo::ji(\"folder\") to get 📂 or emo::ji(\"news\") to get 📰!\nBut I still need to get my text aligned properly… So I broke some formatting rules for normal code, but it got the job done for this rtweet use! Basically, I forced the text to be fully left-aligned, added in some spacing where necessary, and used paste0() to get everything squished together in a coherent tweet (with multiple pics!).\n\n\nrtweet::post_tweet(status = paste0(\n\"The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week 2 of #TidyTuesday!  We're exploring *esoteric topic*!\n \n\",\n        emo::ji(\"folder\"),\n        \" http://bit.ly/tidyreadme\n\",\n        emo::ji(\"news\"),\n        \" http://cool.article.com\n\n#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz\"),\n\n# The below code is relative to my project\n# You need to specify path to the images for tweeting\n\n        media = c(\"tt_logo.png\",\n                  \"tt_rules.png\")\n        )\n\n\nThis is a great start! However, I want to make this a bit more robust, as I don’t want to edit it all by hand, when I can generate it programmatically. Refactoring code is always an adventure, so let’s take a look at our code to see what is static and what changes.\nMix of static and dynamic:\nThe @r4dscommunity welcomes you to week {week} of #Tidy Tuesday\nWe're exploring {data to explore}!\nThe link to the readme is static, but we change the link to an article.\nThe logo and rules are always the same, but up to two additional pics are dynamic.\nSo how do you generate dynamic and static text together? With glue of course! The glue package glues strings together in R, and allows for interpreted strings with the use of {} for example glue::glue(\"Glue is an {adjective} package!\") where the {adjective} indicates an intepreted add-in. So if I had adjective <- \"awesome\" the string would print as \"Glue is an awesome package!\".\nSince we are going to be linking local pics, I’m also using the here package to make moving between folders in my project easier. My folder is organized like so: TidyTuesday/2019/2019-01-08/.\nSo I can use here::here(\"2019\", \"2019-01-08\", \"pic1.png\") to get the file directory for pic1.png. Since the date 2019-01-08 changes each week, I will also add it as a variable to define.\nAnyway, back to refactoring.\n\n\n# Dynamic Variables\nweek_num <- 2\nexploring <- \"Esoteric data!\"\nshort_link <- \"http://bit.ly/WHATEVER\"\nweek_date <- \"2019-01-08\"\n\n# Static framework\nrtweet::post_tweet(status = glue::glue(\n\"The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week {week_num} of #TidyTuesday!  We're exploring {exploring}!\n \n\",\n        emo::ji(\"folder\"),\n        \" http://bit.ly/tidyreadme\n\",\n        emo::ji(\"news\"),\n        \" {short_link}\n\n#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz\"),\n# The below code is relative to my project\n# You would need to specify path to the images for tweeting\n        media = c(here::here(\"static_img\", \"tt_logo.png\"),   # I have two static pics\n                  here::here(\"static_img\", \"tt_rules.png\"),  # so they go in /static\n                  here::here(\"2019\", week_date, \"pic1.png\"), # notice I have week_date\n                  here::here(\"2019\", week_date, \"pic2.png\")  # here instead of 2019-01-01\n        ))\n\nNow this will generate the correctly formatted tweet, include the correct additional pictures and text, but more importantly the use of glue and here means I can define the dynamic portions at the top and leave the static body the same.\nHowever, we can refactor things further!\nWe can refactor to a function AND since I only post these tweets on the Monday before #TidyTuesday, I can build variable dates into the function. Really the only thing I need to manually change is what data we are exploring and the short article link.\nBefore we get into the function, I am using a number of packages for my ease.\n\n\n# Packages used in this script\nlibrary(rtweet) # For Tweeting\nlibrary(glue) # For interpretation inside strings\nlibrary(emo) # For emojis!\nlibrary(lubridate) # Working with date-times\nlibrary(here) # Easier file navigation inside projects\nlibrary(purrr) # for pluck - I'm lazy. :shrug:\n\n\n\n# Only two inputs!\n# exploring = what we are exploring in text\n# short_link = the article link\n\npost_tidytuesday <- function(exploring, short_link){\n        \n        # set date for files structure and names\n        week_date <- as.character(lubridate::today() + 1)\n        \n        # Today's date + 1 = tomorrow\n        # Then time diff between tomorrow and 1st tidytuesday in number of weeks\n        week_num <- as.numeric((lubridate::today() + 1) - lubridate::ymd(20190101))/7 + 1\n        \n        # post the tweet with fill\n        rtweet::post_tweet(status = glue::glue(\n                \"The @R4DScommunity welcomes you to week {week_num} of #TidyTuesday!  We're exploring {exploring}!\n \n\",\n                emo::ji(\"folder\"),\n                \" http://bit.ly/tidyreadme\n\",\n                emo::ji(\"news\"),\n                \" {short_link}\n\n#r4ds #tidyverse #rstats #dataviz\"),\n                \n                # The below code is relative to my project\n                # You need to specify path to the images for tweeting\n                media = c(here::here(\"static_img\", \"tt_logo.png\"),\n                          here::here(\"static_img\", \"tt_rules.png\"),\n                          here::here(\"2019\", week_date, \"pic1.png\"),\n                          here::here(\"2019\", week_date, \"pic1.png\")\n                ))    \n}\n\nNow we have a nice function and when I want to post on Monday morning, I can just do the following!\n\n\npost_tidytuesday(\n  exploring = \"Esoteric data!\",\n  short_link = \"http://bit.ly/tidy_post\"\n)\n\nThe link to GitHub for this code.\nPackage Links\nrtweetglueemolubridateherepurrr::pluck()\nStep 2 (for next time)\nHow to improve YOUR #TidyTuesday process and get your code directly from RStudio into Carbon.now.sh for pretty “screenshots”!\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\nOver the past month or so, the r4ds online learning community founded by Jesse Maegan has been developing projects intended to help connect mentors and learners. One of the first projects born out of this collaboration is #TidyTuesday, a weekly social data project focused on using tidyverse packages to clean, wrangle, tidy, and plot a new dataset every Tuesday.\nIf you are interested in joining the r4ds online learning community check out Jesse Maegan’s post here!\nEvery Monday we will release a new dataset on our GitHub that has been tamed, but does not always adhere to “tidy” data principles. This dataset will come from an article with an interesting plot. Our goal is to have you take a look at the raw data, and generate either a copy of the original plot or a novel take on the data! You can obviously use whatever techniques you feel are appropriate, but the data will be organized in a way that tidyverse tools will work well!\nWhy such an emphasis on the tidyverse?\nThe typical Tidyverse workflowThe tidyverse is an “opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.” The tidyverse is at the core of the the R for Data Science text written by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This book is aimed to be beginner-friendly but also deep enough to empower R experts as well. The framework of both the book and the tidyverse package is seen above.\nWe focus on the tidyverse package as the r4ds online learning community was founded “with the goal of creating a supportive and responsive online space for learners and mentors to gather and work through the R for Data Science text”. Beyond that, the tidyverse is consistent, powerful, and typically more beginner friendly. It is a good framework to get started with, and is complementary to base R (or the 1000s of other R packages).\nGuidelines for TidyTuesday\nTo participate in TidyTuesday, you need to do a few things:\nCreate and save an image of a plot from R\nSave the code used to recreate your plot (include data tidy steps!)\nSubmit the plot and code on Twitter\nUse the #TidyTuesday hashtag (you can also tag me @thomas_mock)\nBrowse other submissions and like/comment on their work!\nHowever, that might seem like a lot! So at minimum please submit your plot with the hashtag #TidyTuesday.\nAll data will be posted on the data sets page on Monday. It will include the link to the original article (for context) and to the data set.\nIf you want to work on GitHub (a useful data science skill) feel free to post your code on GitHub! This will allow others to see and use your code, whereas an image of the code means they would have to re-type everything! Additionally, hosting on GitHub gives you a Data Science Portfolio to talk about/show in interviews, and allows you to access your code across different computers easily!\nGitHub link!\nGitHub Guide!\nYou can also upload your code into Carbon, a website the generates a high-quality image of your code.\nLastly, if you create your plot with the tidyverse you can save high quality ggplot2 images!\nRules for TidyTuesday\nWe welcome all newcomers, enthusiasts, and experts to participate, but be mindful of a few things:\nThis is NOT about criticizing the original authors. They are people like you and me and they have feelings. Focus on the data, the charts and improving your own techniques.\nThis is NOT about criticizing or tearing down your fellow #RStats practitioners! Be supportive and kind to each other! Like other’s posts and help promote the #RStats community!\nThe data set comes from the source article or the source that the article credits. Be mindful that the data is what it is and Tidy Tuesday is designed to help you practice data visualization and basic data wrangling.\nUse the hashtag #TidyTuesday on Twitter if you create your own version and would like to share it.\nInclude a picture of the visualisation when you post to Twitter.\nInclude a copy of the code used to create your visualization when you post to Twitter. Comment your code wherever possible to help yourself and others understand your process!\nFocus on improving your craft, even if you end up with someting simple! Make something quick, but purposeful!\nGive credit to the original data source whenever possible.\nThis week’s submissions!\nEveryone did such a great job! I’m posting all the ones that I can find through the hashtag, you can always tag me in your post to make sure you get noticed in the future.\n\n\nIf you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.— George Bernard Shaw#TidyTuesday - spreading ideas!\n\n— Thomas Mock (@thomas_mock) April

    "contents": "\n\nWhen you first started in R you likely were writing simple code to generate one outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello world!\"\n\n\n\n5 * 6\n\n[1] 30\n\n\n\nx <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\n\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5\n\nThis is great, you are learning about strings, math, and vectors in R!\nThen you get started with some basic analyses. You want to see if you can find the mean of some numbers.\n\n\nemployee <- c('John Doe','Peter Gynn','Jolie Hope')\nsalary <- c(21000, 23400, 26800)\nstartdate <- as.Date(c('2010-11-1','2008-3-25','2007-3-14'))\n\n# form dataframe and take mean of salary column\nemploy_data <- data.frame(employee, salary, startdate)\nmean(employ_data$salary)\n\n[1] 23733.33\n\nEventually you hopefully get exposed to the tidyverse, and you find how this “opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science” makes data analysis in R easier and more readable!\n\n\nmtcars %>% \n  group_by(cyl) %>% \n  summarize(mean(mpg))\n\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\n    cyl `mean(mpg)`\n  <dbl>       <dbl>\n1     4        26.7\n2     6        19.7\n3     8        15.1\n\nEverything is going great! You’ve likely replaced Excel at this point, and potentially SPSS or some other statistical software suite! But then you run into a problem where you need to use a function repeatedly.\nYou could use something like the following code to calculate one-way ANOVAs for some dependent variables and a set independent variable:\n\n\naov_mpg <- aov(mpg ~ factor(cyl), data = mtcars)\nsummary(aov_mpg)\n\naov_disp <- aov(disp ~ factor(cyll), data = mtcars)\nsummary(aov_disp)\n\naov_hp <- aov(hp ~ factor(cyl), data = mrcars)\nsummry(aov_hpp)\n\naov_wt <- aov(wt ~ factor(cyl), datas = mtcars)\nsummary(aov_wt)\n\nBut you copy-pasted code 3x, and oops you made some minor misspelling mistakes which throws an error! (The above code leads to errors!)\nAlso, what if you realized that you wanted to actually run these ANOVAs for number of gears instead of number of cylinders? You would have to go back and change the factor(cyl) call to factor(gear) 4x! This is not very efficient, and you’re more likely to end up with mistakes as you have to type everything multiple times!\nHow about another example.\nLet’s calculate the R-squared values for the linear relationship between Weight and Miles per Gallon, according to the number of Cylinders.\nI have written code below that does this for 4 cylinder cars from the mtcars dataset. This is a worst case scenario, you know some dplyr code (dplyr::filter), but are not comfortable with the pipe. That’s fine, you accomplish your goal but a lot of coding! You would have to duplicate this code for 6 cylinder and 8 cylinder cars, for even more code…\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n# create df for 4 cylinder cars\ncyl_4 <- filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)\n\n# create a linear model on 4 cyl cars\nlm_4 <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = cyl_4)\n\n# get the summ\nlm_4_summary <- summary(lm_4)\n\n# get the r.squared value\nlm_4cyl_r_squared <- lm_4_summary[\"r.squared\"]\n\n# check the value\nlm_4cyl_r_squared\n\n$r.squared\n[1] 0.5086326\n\nAlternatively, you could do the same thing with the pipe. A lot less typing, but to do this for all 3 subsets means we have to copy paste multiple times, so if you end up wanting to do this as a linear model of mpg ~ disp in addition to mpg ~ wt, you would have to duplicate the code 3 more times and change it 3 more times. This may not seem like a big deal, but eventually is a huge deal once you start to scale up the code (say 10+ times or 100+ times, etc).\n\n\n# piped analysis\nlm_4cyl_rsquared <- mtcars %>% \n  filter(cyl == 4) %>%\n  lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .) %>% \n  summary() %>% \n  .$\"r.squared\"\n\n#check output\nlm_4cyl_r_squared\n\n$r.squared\n[1] 0.5086326\n\nTo solve this issue of minimizing repetition with further replication, we can dive straight into purrr! To read more about purrr Hadley Wickham recommends the iteration chapter from “R for Data Science” or alternatively you can look at the purrr documentation. Lastly, Jenny Bryan has a great purrr tutorial here. You can load purrr by itself, but it is also loaded as part of the tidyverse library.\nI used to be all meep—meep—PANIC about purrr!!now I’m all like map %>% map %>% PARTY!purrr allows you to map functions to data. Appropriately the basic function in purrr is called map()! The map functions transform their input by applying a function to each element and returning a vector the same length as the input.\nThe base arguments for map() are: .x - list or atomic vector (logical, integer, double/numeric, and character) .f - function, formula, or atomic vector\nBasically map() takes a function (.f) and applies it to data (.x).\nGoing back to our example of grabbing the R-squared from a linear model, we use the following code with purrr.\n\n\nmtcars %>%\n  split(.$cyl) %>%\n  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>%\n  map(summary) %>%\n  map_dbl(\"r.squared\")\n\n        4         6         8 \n0.5086326 0.4645102 0.4229655 \n\nThis generates an output from all 3 of our linear models according to number of cylinders in 5 lines of code! This is the beauty of purrr, efficient scaling of functions!\nLet’s break down our linear model R-squared code.\nWe take the mtcars dataset, split it into data subsets according to the number of cylinders, apply a linear model of mpg by wt to each subset of data, apply a summary function and then pull out the r.squared value. However, while purrr is readable, we need to cover a few quirks of using it.\n\n\nmtcars %>%\n  split(.$cyl) %>%\n  map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)) %>%\n  map(summary) %>%\n  map_dbl(\"r.squared\")\n\n        4         6         8 \n0.5086326 0.4645102 0.4229655 \n\nFor our code here you may have noticed we have a “.” placed twice within the code. This is a placeholder for the data, we can see this below. The “.” indicate the left-hand side data, or in this case mtcars. Our split call splits the mtcars dataframe into 3 dataframes, each stored within a list. This may seem odd, but it allows map to cycle through our 3 dataframes and replicate the lm() function on each of them individually.\n\n\n# piped version\nmtcars %>% \n  split(.$cyl)\n\n\n\n# base R version\nsplit(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)\n\n\n\n$`4`\n                mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nDatsun 710     22.8   4 108.0  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\nMerc 240D      24.4   4 146.7  62 3.69 3.190 20.00  1  0    4    2\nMerc 230       22.8   4 140.8  95 3.92 3.150 22.90  1  0    4    2\nFiat 128       32.4   4  78.7  66 4.08 2.200 19.47  1  1    4    1\nHonda Civic    30.4   4  75.7  52 4.93 1.615 18.52  1  1    4    2\nToyota Corolla 33.9   4  71.1  65 4.22 1.835 19.90  1  1    4    1\nToyota Corona  21.5   4 120.1  97 3.70 2.465 20.01  1  0    3    1\nFiat X1-9      27.3   4  79.0  66 4.08 1.935 18.90  1  1    4    1\nPorsche 914-2  26.0   4 120.3  91 4.43 2.140 16.70  0  1    5    2\nLotus Europa   30.4   4  95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90  1  1    5    2\nVolvo 142E     21.4   4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60  1  1    4    2\n\n$`6`\n                mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4      21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag  21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nHornet 4 Drive 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nValiant        18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nMerc 280       19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C      17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\nFerrari Dino   19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6\n\n$`8`\n                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nHornet Sportabout   18.7   8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\nDuster 360          14.3   8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84  0  0    3    4\nMerc 450SE          16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SL          17.3   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60  0  0    3    3\nMerc 450SLC         15.2   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00  0  0    3    3\nCadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4\nLincoln Continental 10.4   8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4\nChrysler Imperial   14.7   8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42  0  0    3    4\nDodge Challenger    15.5   8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87  0  0    3    2\nAMC Javelin         15.2   8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30  0  0    3    2\nCamaro Z28          13.3   8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41  0  0    3    4\nPontiac Firebird    19.2   8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05  0  0    3    2\nFord Pantera L      15.8   8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50  0  1    5    4\nMaserati Bora       15.0   8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60  0  1    5    8\n\nSimilarily, the “.” in or first map call is a placeholder for data, but in this case it will cycle through our list of 3 dataframes generated by the previous pipe.

I hope that this guide motivates you to add purrr to your toolbox and explore this useful tidyverse package!\nAs a brief teaser to some more applications of purrr, I’ll leave you with this example. I mentioned calculating ANOVAs across multiple variables at the beginning. Break down this example on your own and see what you think! (You can copy paste this code into R, but need to load the tidyverse and broom packages first).\n\n\nmtcars %>%\n  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl)) %>%\n  select(mpg, disp, hp) %>%\n  map(~ aov(.x ~ cyl, data = mtcars)) %>%\n  map_dfr(~ broom::tidy(.), .id = 'source') %>%\n  mutate(p.value = round(p.value, 5))\n\nIn closing, I’d like to thank several #r4ds Online Learning Community members for their help in my personal understanding of purrr: Frank Farach, Michael Kuehn, and Kent Johnson.\nIf you are interested in joining this community led by Jesse Maegan check out her post here!\n\n\n",

These data correspond to a new (fake) research drug called AD-x37, a theoretical drug that has been shown to have beneficial outcomes on cognitive decline in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease. In the current experiment we will be statistically testing whether the drug was effective in reducing cognitive impairment in dementia patients. See the data HERE.\nWe will be using MMSE (mini-mental status exam) scores to assess the degree of cognitive impairment. In a real clinical trial, many other variables would be recorded, but for the sake of a straightforward but multi-variate example we will stick to just MMSE.\nSource: Folstein et al, 1975, J Psychiatr Res 12:189–198We will be working through loading, plotting, analyzing, and saving the outputs of our analysis through the tidyverse, an “opinionated collection of R packages” designed for data analysis. We will limit dependence to two packages: tidyverse and broomwhile using base R for the rest. These two packages dramatically improve the data analysis workflow in my opinion. While other stats-heavy packages provide additional statistical testing, base R has a decent ability to perform statistical analyses out of the box. I will use knitr::kable to generate some html tables for a markdown document, but it is not necessary for the workflow.\nAdditionally, I will be uploading the Excel Sheet used in this example, so that you can re-create the workflow on your own. You can simply copy-paste the code seen here and it will run in R. If you would rather see the entire workflow in an R-Markdown document, please see here. R Markdown is a document created inside R that allows you to write code, execute it inline, and write comments/notes as you go. You could think of it like being able to write R code inside a basic Word document (but it can do a lot more than that!).\nAlthough you may not be interested in the dataset I have provided, this hopefully provides a clear workflow for you to swap in your data of interest and accomplish a basic analysis!\nLoad the tidyverse, broom, and knitr\nUsing the library function we will load the tidyverse. If you have never installed it before you can also use the install.packages(\"tidyverse\") call to install it for the first time. This package includes ggplot2 (graphs), dplyr/tidyr (summary statistics, data manipulation), and readxl (reading excel files) as well as the pipe %>%which will make our code much more readable! We will also load the broom package to tidy up some of our statistical outputs. Lastly we will load knitr for making nice html tables via knitr::kable, but not necessary for simply saving the outputs to Excel.\n\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(broom)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nThis will output some message about the packages being loaded and any conflicts of function calls.\nLoading the data\nWhile I am calling readxl::read_xlsx you could also simply use read_xlsx, but in the interest of transparency, I will be using the full call to begin. The concept of calling a function with the use of :: is important as some packages have conflicts in functions, for example multiple packages include the function select and summarize. As such, we can clarify from which package we want R to call our function from, so package::function ! To read more about the concept of “namespace” when calling functions, please look here.\nreadxl is unfortunately a funny case, as installing the tidyverse installs readxl, but readxl is not loaded when loading the tidyverse via a library call. As such we must either load readxl like any other package or call both the package and the name as in readxl::read_xlsx. readxl allows us to read .xls, .xlsx files into R. Alternatively, you could convert your Excel sheet into .csv, which can be read by read_csv(). By using the glimpse function from dplyr we can see how the variables were imported, as well as the first few rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRows: 600\nColumns: 5\n$ age            <int> 80, 85, 82, 80, 83, 79, 82, 79, 80, 79, 80, …\n$ sex            <int> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1,…\n$ health_status  <chr> \"Healthy\", \"Healthy\", \"Healthy\", \"Healthy\", …\n$ drug_treatment <chr> \"Placebo\", \"Placebo\", \"Placebo\", \"Placebo\", …\n$ mmse           <dbl> 24.78988, 24.88192, 25.10903, 24.92636, 23.3…\n\nWe can collect some information about the dataset now. Namely, we have our 3 categorical/factor variables: sex, health_status, and drug_treatment and 1 dependent variable (DV): mmse. We also have age, but importantly it is recorded as a discrete number instead of as a factor (eg as 85 years, instead of old). Thus we can look at age, but we will not use it as a factor in our ANOVA.\nChecking the data distribution\nWe will use our first ggplot2call to create a graph showing the distribution of age. To break down what we are doing, we need to call ggplot, tell it what data to use, and use the aes or aesthetic call to assign the x coordinate. We then add a + which tells ggplot to include the next line of code. The geom_density tells R that we want to make create a density distribution layer and we want to fillit with a blue color! For more info about ggplot2 please go HERE or here.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows us that age really only goes from 79–85 years, and that there is really not any age over or underrepresented. We can confirm the age ranges by a dplyr::summarize call or by calling range in base R. As a slight aside, we can now talk about using the pipe or %>%. The pipe passes the results or data from the left of it to the right. For more info about the pipe, please see here.\nWe can read the following code as take raw_df and then summarize it by taking the min and max of the age variable. Now because we started with raw_df R understands we want to take the column age from this dataframe.\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 x 2\n    min   max\n  <int> <int>\n1    79    85\n\nAlternatively we could use the base R range function, which requires the use of $ . The dollar sign indicates that R should use the age column from raw_df. Both of these functions give us the same results, the minimum number and maximum number.\n\n\n[1] 79 85\n\nFor more information about using these two syntaxes look here or for cheat sheets look here.\nWhat about the experimental variables levels?\nNow while I am very aware of the variables in this dataframe, you might not be without exploring it! To quickly determine drug_treatment groups, health_status groups and how they interact we can do a table call. By calling it on both drug_treatment and health_status, we get a nice table breaking down how many rows are in each of the variable groups.\n\n\ntable(raw_df$drug_treatment, raw_df$health_status)\n\n           \n            Alzheimer's Healthy\n  High Dose         100     100\n  Low dose          100     100\n  Placebo           100     100\n\nAlternatively we can do the same thing in dplyr with the following code.\n\n\nraw_df %>% \n  group_by(drug_treatment, health_status) %>% \n  count()\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 3\n# Groups:   drug_treatment, health_status [6]\n  drug_treatment health_status     n\n  <chr>          <chr>         <int>\n1 High Dose      Alzheimer's     100\n2 High Dose      Healthy         100\n3 Low dose       Alzheimer's     100\n4 Low dose       Healthy         100\n5 Placebo        Alzheimer's     100\n6 Placebo        Healthy         100\n\nNow we know the levels of our variables of interest, and that there are 100 patients per overall treatment group!\nData exploration of dependent variable\nBefore running our summary statistics we can actually visualize the range, central tendency and quartiles via a geom_boxplot call.\n\n\nggplot(data = raw_df, # add the data\n       aes(x = drug_treatment, y = mmse, # set x, y coordinates\n           color = drug_treatment)) +    # color by treatment\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_grid(~health_status) # create panes base on health status\n\n\nWe have split the data into separate graph facets (or panes) for healthy and Alzheimer’s patients, as well as into groups within each facet by drug treatment. This graph tells us a few things of interest for later. It definitely looks like we have an effect with our (fake) awesome drug! Let’s explore that with descriptive statistics.\nWhile this is an exploratory graph and we don’t necessarily want to “tweak” it to perfection, we can take note that our drug treatment should be ordered Placebo < Low dose < High Dose and we should have Healthy patients presented first, and Alzheimer’s patients second. This is something we can fix in our next section!\nSummary Statistics\nWe are looking to generate the mean and standard error for mmse scores, this is useful as a measure of central tendency, and for creating our final publication graphs. We have our categorical variables of sex, drug treatment, and health status. However going back to our glimpse call from earlier, we can see that the data is not ‘coded’ properly. Namely, sex is a dbl (number), without a descriptive name, and health_status/drug_treatment are chr (characters)! These need to be converted into factors!\n\n\nRows: 600\nColumns: 5\n$ age            <int> 80, 85, 82, 80, 83, 79, 82, 79, 80, 79, 80, …\n$ sex            <int> 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1,…\n$ health_status  <chr> \"Healthy\", \"Healthy\", \"Healthy\", \"Healthy\", …\n$ drug_treatment <chr> \"Placebo\", \"Placebo\", \"Placebo\", \"Placebo\", …\n$ mmse           <dbl> 24.78988, 24.88192, 25.10903, 24.92636, 23.3…\n\nWe can use the dplyr::mutate function to tell R we want to change (mutate) the rows within a variable of interest. So we will take the data in the sex, drug_treatment, and health_status columns and convert them from either just numbers or characters into a factor variable! dplyr::mutate can also perform math, and many other interesting things. For more information please see here.\nWe will use the mutate function and the base R factor function to convert our variables into the proper factors, and give them labels (for sex) or reorder the levels of the factors.\nWe need to be REALLY careful to type the labels EXACTLY as they appear in the column or it will replace those misspelled with a NA. For example, did you notice that High Dose has a capital “D” while Low dose has a lower case “d”?\n\n\nsum_df <- raw_df %>% \n            mutate(\n              sex = factor(sex, \n                  labels = c(\"Male\", \"Female\")),\n              drug_treatment =  factor(drug_treatment, \n                  levels = c(\"Placebo\", \"Low dose\", \"High Dose\")),\n              health_status = factor(health_status, \n                  levels = c(\"Healthy\", \"Alzheimer's\"))\n              )\nglimpse(sum_df)\n\nAs powerful as R is, it needs explicit and accurate code input to accomplish the end goals. As such, if we had typed “High dose” it would give an NA, while “High Dose” outputs correctly. We now see age and mmse as dbl (numerics) and sex, health_status, and drug_treatment as factors.\n\n\nRows: 600\nColumns: 5\n$ age            <int> 80, 85, 82, 80, 83, 79, 82, 79, 80, 79, 80, …\n$ sex            <fct> Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Ma…\n$ health_status  <fct> Healthy, Healthy, Healthy, Healthy, Healthy,…\n$ drug_treatment <fct> Placebo, Placebo, Placebo, Placebo, Placebo,…\n$ mmse           <dbl> 24.78988, 24.88192, 25.10903, 24.92636, 23.3…\n\nNow that everything is coded properly, we can calculate our mean and standard error (se = standard deviation/square root of number of samples)! We will use the dplyr::group_by to tell R which factors we want to… group by! Then we will create named summaries by first calling dplyr::summarize and then specifying which summaries we want with mmse_mean and mmse_seand the number of samples n(). Lastly we will ungroup, which removes the group_by code from the dataframe.\n\n\nsum_df <- sum_df %>%   \n  group_by(sex, health_status, drug_treatment) %>%  \n  summarize(mmse_mean = mean(mmse),   \n            mmse_se = sd(mmse)/sqrt(n()),\n            n_samples = n()) %>%\n  ungroup() # ungrouping variable is a good habit to prevent errors\n\nNow we have a nicely formatted dataframe that can be saved to Excel, or used in graphing. We need to indicate what data we are writing (sum_df) and what we want the resulting file to be named (“adx37_sum_stats.csv”).\n\n\n# code to save the table into a .csv Excel file\nwrite.csv(sum_df, \"adx37_sum_stats.csv\")\n\nSummary graph\nBy calling a ggplot function we can generate a preliminary summary graph.\n\n\nggplot(data = sum_df, # add the data\n       aes(x = drug_treatment,  #set x, y coordinates\n           y = mmse_mean,\n           group = drug_treatment,  # group by treatment\n           color = drug_treatment)) +    # color by treatment\n  geom_point(size = 3) + \n  facet_grid(sex~health_status) # create facets by sex and status\n\n\nWe can now see that the graph is properly sorted by drug treatment and by health status. We still have some work to do on the final graph, but let’s move on to the ANOVAs first!\nThe ANOVA finally!\nWe will be prepping a dataframe for analysis via ANOVA. We need to again make sure we have our factors as factors via mutate, and in the correct order. This is necessary for the ANOVA/post-hoc testing to work, and to make the post-hocs and the ANOVA outputs easier to read.\n\n\nRows: 600\nColumns: 5\n$ age            <int> 80, 85, 82, 80, 83, 79, 82, 79, 80, 79, 80, …\n$ sex            <fct> Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Male, Ma…\n$ health_status  <fct> Healthy, Healthy, Healthy, Healthy, Healthy,…\n$ drug_treatment <fct> Placebo, Placebo, Placebo, Placebo, Placebo,…\n$ mmse           <dbl> 24.78988, 24.88192, 25.10903, 24.92636, 23.3…\n\nThat gets our dataframe into working status!\nCalling the ANOVA is a done via the aov function. The basic syntax is shown via pseudocode below. We put the dependent variable first (mmse in our case), then a ~ then the independent variable we want to test. Lastly we specify what data to use.\n\n\n\nWe can add our real data set via the code below, but because we have 3 independent variables we have a choice to make. We can simply look for main effects by adding a + in between each of our variables, or we can look for both main effects and interactions by adding a * between each variable. Make sure to not replace the + or * with commas, as that will lead to an error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy assigning the ANOVA to the ad_aov object, we can then call summary on it to look at the results of the ANOVA.\n\n\n                                  Df Sum Sq Mean Sq  F value Pr(>F)\nsex                                1      0       0    0.047  0.828\ndrug_treatment                     2   3601    1801  909.213 <2e-16\nhealth_status                      1  10789   10789 5447.953 <2e-16\nsex:drug_treatment                 2      8       4    2.070  0.127\nsex:health_status                  1      5       5    2.448  0.118\ndrug_treatment:health_status       2   2842    1421  717.584 <2e-16\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status   2      5       2    1.213  0.298\nResiduals                        588   1164       2                \n                                    \nsex                                 \ndrug_treatment                   ***\nhealth_status                    ***\nsex:drug_treatment                  \nsex:health_status                   \ndrug_treatment:health_status     ***\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status    \nResiduals                           \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nThe summary gives us the degrees of freedom, sum of squares, mean squares, F value, and the p value. I added a bold emphasis on the <2e -16, these p values are so small that R switches to scientific notation. So we see significant main effects of drug treatment, health status, and an interaction of drug treatment by health status. We can interpret that Alzheimer’s patients had different cognitive scores than healthy, and that drug treatment had an effect on cognitive scores. Importantly, sex was not a significant factor, as p = 0.828. Variables being scored as significant or non-significant can both be important!\nWe can also use broom::tidy to clean up the results of the ANOVA and put them into a dataframe. This is useful for storage, or for automation of some analysis for future ANOVAs.\n\n\n\nHowever, we don’t know the direction of differences, or where exactly the differences were Was it just the high dose? Low dose? Both? We need follow-up post hoc tests to determine these answers!\nPost-hocs > Post-docs (academia jokes < dad jokes)\nWe have multiple ways of looking at post-hocs. I will show two in this section.\nFor the pairwise, we need to use the $ to select columns from each of the dataframes and look at the interaction via :. Our first pairwise has NO correction for multiple comparisons, and is comparable to a unprotected Fisher’s-LSD post-hoc. This is not stringent at all, and given the amount of comparisons we have it is advisable to either move forward with a p.adjusting Bonferonni correction (change p.adj = “none” to p.adj = “bonf”) or the Tukey post-hoc test seen in the next example. You can see that this method is a little jumbled to read due to the dataset$column method and the need for : in between each interaction. We can read this as we want pairwise.t.test for the interaction of sex by drug_treatment by health_status, which gives us every iteration of these factors against the other.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we need to extract the matrix of p values and save to an Excel file for future use.\nWe do this by simply wrapping our ad_last posthoc with broom::tidy.\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 3\n  group1                    group2                     p.value\n  <chr>                     <chr>                        <dbl>\n1 Male:Placebo:Alzheimer's  Male:Placebo:Healthy     1.25e-199\n2 Male:Low dose:Healthy     Male:Placebo:Healthy     9.84e-  1\n3 Male:Low dose:Healthy     Male:Placebo:Alzheimer's 8.68e-198\n4 Male:Low dose:Alzheimer's Male:Placebo:Healthy     8.01e-157\n5 Male:Low dose:Alzheimer's Male:Placebo:Alzheimer's 1.37e- 18\n6 Male:Low dose:Alzheimer's Male:Low dose:Healthy    3.23e-155\n\n\n\n\nThe Tukey post-hoc is a little cleaner to call, and is preferable to the unadjusted pairwise t-test. Notice we also are already wrapping the Tukey results in broom::tidy to save as a tidy dataframe! The TukeyHSD call incorporates the results of the ANOVA call, and is preferable to the previous method.\nThe following code can be read as we want a Tukey post-hoc test on the results of our ad_aov ANOVA across the interactions of sex by drug_treatment by health_status. Notice the quotation marks around ‘sex:drug_treatment:health_status’ and the : in between each variable. These are necessary to tell R how we want the Tukey to be run! Once this is done, R then runs tidy on it to make it into a nice dataframe similar to our previous pairwise test. We can then save the results to Excel!\n\n\n\n\nterm\ncontrast\nnull.value\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\nadj.p.value\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status\nFemale:Placebo:Healthy-Male:Placebo:Healthy\n0\n0.0111117\n-0.9140819\n0.9363052\n1.0000000\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status\nMale:Low dose:Healthy-Male:Placebo:Healthy\n0\n0.0056692\n-0.9000907\n0.9114291\n1.0000000\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status\nFemale:Low dose:Healthy-Male:Placebo:Healthy\n0\n0.0403184\n-0.8748132\n0.9554500\n1.0000000\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status\nMale:High Dose:Healthy-Male:Placebo:Healthy\n0\n0.7762410\n-0.1295189\n1.6820009\n0.1775310\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status\nFemale:High Dose:Healthy-Male:Placebo:Healthy\n0\n0.4360609\n-0.4790707\n1.3511925\n0.9213646\nsex:drug_treatment:health_status\nMale:Placebo:Alzheimer’s-Male:Placebo:Healthy\n0\n-12.8040144\n-13.7053250\n-11.9027038\n0.0000000\n\nPublication Graph\nNow that we have generated our ANOVAs and post-hocs, and saved them to Excel for storage, we can start making a publication-grade graph!\nggplot2 graphs allow for extreme customization, some of the additions I make to this graph are a personal choice, and as such I would recommend discussion with a mentor or experienced member in your field. Bar graphs are ubiquitous in my field, and while I think plotting as a boxplot would tell more about the data, I will initially start with a bar graph.\nOur goal is to plot the means, standard errors, and indicate significance where it occurs. Rather than relying on a package to label significance, I will be handmaking a custom dataframe with the tribble function. There are alternatives to doing it this way, but I can easily control what happens with this method, and it is explicitly apparent what the dataframe contains. The basics of tribble are shown in the below example. We assign columns with the ~ and then explicitly write out what we want in each row of the columns.\n\n\n# A tibble: 3 x 2\n  colA   colB\n  <chr> <dbl>\n1 a         1\n2 b         2\n3 c         3\n\nAnd here is our actual code for making the custom dataframe.\n\n\n\nNow that we have this data frame, we can use it in a geom_text call to label our bars with significance labels as indicated by a *.\nHere is what the final publication graph looks like in ggplot2 code. You’ll notice I assigned it to g1 rather than just calling it directly. This means I will have to call g1 to view the graph, but I can save it now! To read what we are doing, I am calling the initial ggplot call as before, but adding an error bar layer, a bar graph layer, separating into panes for sex and health_status, switching to an alternate appearance (theme_bw), setting the colors manually, making minor adjustments via theme, adding the * for indication of significance, and lastly altering the axis labels while adding a figure caption.\n\n\n\nSaving is done via the ggsave function, where we will need to name the resulting file with surrounding “ “, tell R which ggplot object we want (g1), and indicate the size via height, width, and units. Don’t forget to save the graph with a dpi call to make it nice and crisp!\n\n\n\nAnd the final graph!\n\n\n\nI think it would be a disservice to say you can learn ggplot by simply recreating my example. As such, I would like to point you in the direction of the R for Data Science textbook, as well as the Modern Dive ebook. These free ebooks have a tremendous amount of information that may be beyond what you need to accomplish today, but would serve you well in your future endeavors. Their chapters on data visualization are very helpful for getting started in R plotting!\nThank you\n\nIf you have made it this far, good for you! I hope this was helpful and if you have any questions, I would recommend reaching out on Twitter via the #rstats or #r4ds hashtag, or you can find me @thomas_mock on twitter.\nAdditionally, Jesse Maegan has a R for Data Science Slack channel where you can learn and ask questions as you work through the R for Data Science text, read all about it here!. R Studio (caretakers of the Tidyverse) hosts their own forums.\n\n\n",
