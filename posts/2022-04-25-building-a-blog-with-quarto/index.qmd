## Converting from `distill`

### Change the YAML

YAML items that ported over include: title, description, author, date, categories

Items that needed to be changed:
- `preview` to `image`
- `output: distill::distill_article` to nothing (although you will set `format: html` in the `_quarto.yml`)
- drop `base_url` from each article - add to `_quarto.yml`

I also had a lot of use for things like tabsets from `xaringanExtra`, `<aside>` from `distill` and lots of broken code from 3 years ago `r emo::ji("upside_down_face")`.

You're in charge of creating sub-folders and file names, so you can either revert back to `distill` style posts with kebab-case dates eg:

`posts/2022-04-25-blog-with-quarto/blog-with-quarto.qmd`

Or start with an alternative format like splitting by date:

`posts/2022/04/25/index.qmd`

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Expand for Session Info
```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(sessioninfo)
# save the session info as an object
pkg_sesh <- session_info(pkgs = "attached")

# get the quarto version
quarto_version <- system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE)

# inject the quarto info
pkg_sesh$platform$quarto <- paste(
  system("quarto --version", intern = TRUE), 
  "@", 
  quarto::quarto_path()
  )

# print it out
pkg_sesh
```
